i haven’t been writing much lately. i’ve strayed from the practice. it’s unusual, my first true encounter with writer’s block since i started committing to this practice a little over two years ago. but perhaps not so unusual, as i’ve been encountering big shifts in the structure of my life. my core relationships have fallen away or shifted; within the same week in february, i quit my job, experienced the end of a romantic partnership, and had my three roommates announce their intention to leave the apartment. work, love, and home all began to teeter. and while i certainly maintained some core stability (in health, in finances), i’m still adjusting to the changes. 

some part of me used to believe in suffering as the fount of creativity. neoliberal individualism fosters the idea that personal victimhood offers us a path to stand out. in suffering, you gain the agency to stake a claim to others’ attention. this feels good, affirms our need to be taken seriously. but it’s a game that cannot end well. if suffering is the primary or only path to creative agency, then art will develop (and has developed!) a complex alongside the systems that foster suffering in the first place. 

increasingly, though, i find that creativity — which is, at its core, liberation — flows most effusively from safety. it is in safety that we can allow ourselves to dream. in safety that we find the agency to orient ourselves towards something, rather than away from. or at least, this is how i experience it. it seems to me that seeking otherwise is to adopt a flightly posture, constantly seeking something new. this is an exhausting endeavor, particularly when newness can be found all around us. and, perhaps most potently, inside ourselves as we tumble through the current of a constantly-shifting world. 

in the times of the past couple months when my life has felt like it is all falling apart, like the teetering will lead to a tumble and my carefully constructed life will become irredeemably corrupted, i’ve reconnected with the questions of what exactly makes a safe creative environment. the answers are still to be uncovered, gradually. a project of life.

mostly, i just feel as though i’m trying *so damn hard.* i’m trying to make an artful life. to live well. trying, too, not to shirk away from the change, retreat into habitual comforts. instead, i’m inhabiting in, looking around, making note of the changes as they come to me. i feel as though i’ve been chewed up and spit out by my attempts at normativity. or my attempts to conform to others — not necessarily in the violent enforced way of heteropatriarchy, but more so in the aspirational way we mold ourselves to one another in pursuit of connection. 

i don’t feel shameful about this; there’s a great joy in shaping yourself to others. in making a space within yourself to let others in. but it also leaves you holey, loose. grief is a sharp wind, echoing, reverberating within these newly-opened spaces. then it settles within you, spreading like the rich sediment of a river delta. 

i feel those grains within me, speaking truths about who i am and what i am seeking in my life. lately, when friends have asked me how i’m doing, i’ll reach for a metaphor: i am the magnolia blossoms of early spring, newly open, tenderly exposed to the world. battered by the rainy winds of early spring, yet still steadfast in their commitment to the endeavor of being known, being loved by the world. a magnolia tree will burst into spring with the symphony of some hundreds of flowers, a naked display of desire aligned with seasonal rhythms. why should we be so blind to the relationship between desire and natural patterns within ourselves? i want to meet the spring with my petals unfurled, even as i nurse my wounds of disconnection.

as it turns out, magnolia blossoms can have a pleasant taste, slightly gingery, slightly minty. the other day, robin brought home bags of blossoms for pickling and making syrup. a few weeks ago, eden and i foraged for supplies to make magnolia snap cookies. at risk of stretching the metaphor too far, i find myself comforted by the idea that my own exposed tenderness might metabolize into something so sweet as a crunchy gingery cookie. 

and, also, opportunities. i’m freelancing now, finding new structures to bring me the income to survive and the creative agency to explore. my new roommates offer the hope for a home that feels welcoming to myself and others. and i’m slowly opening myself up to new love. it’s been far from a uniform path out of the instability of change and into these new, ever-so-slightly more stable configurations. i’ve had weeks of hopeful optimism, weeks of despairing detachment. but i’m emerging into something new, that will inspire and challenge me in ways i can’t yet name. also, then, i return to writing, as a way to connect with my loved ones and explore the depths of my experience.
