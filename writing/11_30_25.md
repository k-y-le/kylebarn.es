sunday evening and i’m devouring a pomegranate, greedy. popping a handful of seeds at a time in my mouth, each crunch a bright dance across my mouth. what luxury is this! i have want for so little, in this life. 

kayla, this morning, gently asked me - is that your pomegranate? do you want me to open it for you? we have been wandering the apartment today in a hushed quiet. which sometimes feels ghostly, but today is more gentle. a calm coexistence to mirror the steady wet brought by the late fall stratus clouds. or at least that’s how i see it; i haven’t consulted kayla on the vibe of the day, yet. 

i’ve spent my day deep in appreciation of the interplay of colors between the red prius and the orange leaves of the young tree across the street. i peek through my blinds, check they’re still there. i wonder which will leave first, the car or the color of the leaves? it’s the last day of november, hardly above freezing outside, and still i find a single aster flower clinging on in the walkway to fifth ave, its purple losing hue to the settling gray of winter. sometimes it seems like change comes complete, total, but there are always stragglers.

how funny that i know the name of the red car but not the little tree with the orange leaves. they call the walkway where i spied the aster paseo place, so named after the apartment buildings on either side. paseo place, from a spanish word for promenade, or boulevard. prius comes from the latin word for prior, or first. we keep using these words from faraway places to name the things we put on lenape land. pomegranates are native to the middle east and south asia. 

i make a list of things that are lingering. try to name the emotions behind them. what i end up with is a note full of about 20 statements that start with “i feel afraid…” i also make a list of things i am appreciating today. the red car and the orange leaves make it on the list. now i’m going to add the taste of pomegranate. becoming closer with someone or something always entails a shift in my relationship to some other. i cannot avoid this; i have my limits, though i like to pretend otherwise. on my todo list today: “text back everyone ever.” it’s stayed unchecked.

i worry that by sending a newsletter without texting my friends back i’ll annoy them. i worry that saying so has revealed an insecurity around texting that i should keep hidden. i feel afraid. afraid of big things like mortality and small things like spending money, which is really a big thing, too. just a different shape. things change and i have hopes and fears and sometimes i lose track of which is which. i keep pursuing new projects which threaten me with both. 

other things to appreciate: warm socks, seeing the same stranger multiple times in one week, droplets, the word droplet, getting so lost in a book that you feel both in this world and the book world at once (re-read dune today…). the last of the pomegranate seeds, saved for kayla to enjoy tomorrow.
