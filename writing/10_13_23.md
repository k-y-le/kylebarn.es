today i felt it wash over me. the overwhelm. the anger, the grief, the feeling of helplessness. delivered to me via instagram posts and articles and large chunks of text on dark backgrounds and horrific images of tragedy. i&rsquo;m trying to locate this feeling in my body, but it keeps moving. it feels like it&rsquo;s in my stomach, but then i notice a tension in my shoulders, an ache in my knees. a headache develops. i turn off my devices, roll over in bed, let out a low moan. the feeling is diffuse, inescapable. i&rsquo;ve got genocide on my mind.

having a coffee was probably not a good idea. i&rsquo;m still adjusting to caffeine, and jittery focus seems to augment rather than alleviate my anxiety. i&rsquo;ve given up on accomplishing the tasks i set out to do for my work today, and so i sit and i write. i&rsquo;m not sure if this will help, or hurt, or bring me right back where i started. i&rsquo;m not sure if anyone will even care to read what i say. but i&rsquo;m doing this for me, and for my own processing.



in middle school we once did a project where we were asked to create a children&#39;s book about a genocide. it was a daunting task, and sometimes i question the decision to assign it to a bunch of immature 12 year olds. my group was assigned the holodomor, forced starvation of ukrainian peasantry by soviet policies that killed millions. i didn&rsquo;t realize at the time how much this experience would become a touchstone for my own thinking about humanitarian atrocities. at the time, forced starvation on the scale of millions felt distant, unassailable, the thing of a barbaric past.



growing older in an increasingly information-dense world has meant continually re-evaluating the comfortable na&iuml;vet&eacute; of suburban texas. coming to terms with the role my country has played and continues to play in the subjugation of peoples across the world. learning and unlearning the terrible power of colonial dominance. israel is inflicting forced starvation on millions of palestinians, half of whom are children. will future middle school students write children&rsquo;s books about their plight?



we all come to our politics in different ways, out of the maelstrom of influences that our identities, families, upbringing, and education present us with. i&rsquo;ve been frustrated before by my lack of ability to locate the source or early development of mine. somehow, in some way, i came to be guided by a deep conviction for the liberation of all peoples. the challenge, then, has been in understanding how and where that manifests. in looking past the elite capture of rhetorics of inclusion to see where true liberation might lie. in constantly re-negotiating where my trust leads me to implicit or explicit support of subjugation.



in 2019, i posted a series of photos on instagram from a trip to nablus. the cover image was of a mural advocating for the liberation of the palestinian people, in both arabic and english. i captioned it with something akin to &ldquo;lessons learned and unlearned&rdquo; &mdash; fitting for the mysterious socially-engaged cool persona i was attempting to give off. i remember one of my roommates who lived with me in tel aviv at the time commenting &ldquo;aesthetic ðŸ™Œ&rdquo;. i&rsquo;m wondering about the ways that our privilege enables in us a calm consumption of the aesthetics of struggle. how easy it is to signal a dedication to liberation and justice. how complicated these feelings are, how unexpected when they emerge. the aesthetic of palestine has been entangled with aesthetics of violence and subjugation since 1947, now continuing to accelerate towards rubble, chaos. horror. lessons learned and unlearned, indeed.

one of the insidious powers of colonial violence, which is the root cause of all the events across israel-palestine in the past week, is how it induces violence in the oppressor and in the oppressed.&nbsp;the object of settler occupation is to eliminate hope and direct it towards violence. said violence then becomes the rationale for further occupation, destruction, elimination. genocide. that&rsquo;s what settler colonialism does, it produces closed ends. it accelerates conflict to a breaking point. it asks of us to look past it, to justify, until it builds up to a breaking point so powerful that it is beyond even our finely tuned ability to selectively ignore. i&rsquo;m wondering about when we will reach that point, about the information asymmetries that enable a settler government to spin extermination as self-defense, and how long it can keep that up. how long before we collectively realize that settler colonialism hurts all of us? there is no such thing as a peaceful occupation.



my government is not just complicit, we are enabling. it&rsquo;s maddening, to see the horror unfolding before us and witness my president repeat propaganda, my politicians justify war crimes en masse. it&rsquo;s also maddening to see immense energy funneled toward tone policing and semantics that seem motivated by the idea that there is a perfect point of view, a moral high ground upon which we can each wash our hands. this, too, feels like an effect of colonial violence, that search for an impossible panacea. my government is still funding genocide.



for some reason, my mind has been returning to the friend chicken stores i saw in palestine. many of them variants of the KFC acronym. i remember being struck by the aesthetic similarities between these chicken shops and the ones that populate primarily poorer neighborhoods in american cities. what&rsquo;s <em>aesthetic ðŸ™Œ</em>&nbsp;here? i&rsquo;m wondering about the possibility of a sort of chicken-shop solidarity, in recognition of how these stores serve as signifiers of some sort of power imbalance, often manifesting in poorer health conditions in the areas they are located in. but maybe i wouldn&rsquo;t know, after all i am vegetarian.



where do we go from here? as israel prepares for an invasion, the evacuation of over 1M people in gaza of whom surely many will not have time nor resources to escape (and to where?). the US government aids and enables the violence of settler occupation, as it has done time and time again. maybe there&rsquo;s possibility when it comes to shifting the narrative of settler violence, in recognition that it harms everyone involved, that it generates untenable, shaky, violent equilibriums that seem to only raise the stakes of future conflict. maybe there&rsquo;s possibility in resisting the settler project of eliminating the hope of an oppressed people, by creating the tools for coming together in resistance to impending violence.



perhaps the core orienting principle of my life is living well. but what does living well look like under occupation? i&rsquo;m not sure i know enough to answer this question. how does one live well when the oppressor waits at the border, warning of impending destruction of all that you know? what&rsquo;s the point of trying to live well when it&rsquo;s already in question whether or not you will live &mdash; at all? Max Liboiron: &ldquo;Indigenous peoples, settlers, and others have different roles and responsibilities in the challenge to invent, revive, and sustain decolonizing possibilities and persistences.&rdquo;



solidarity, love, and support for all those impacted by the conflict. for the overwhelming grief we have currently and the overwhelming grief to come. it&#39;s always been no to apartheid, no to terror, no to occupation, no to genocide. for the liberation of all palestinian and israeli peoples from settler colonial violence.
