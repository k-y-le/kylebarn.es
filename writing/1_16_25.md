and i am drinking my green tea. steam pours out from my mug, my deep red mug, and i bring my face close to feel the heat on my cheeks. my room is frigid, and i have to keep my hands close to the hot water to keep them from going numb. it’s wintertime, and i shiver to remind myself that i am alive.

my ukrainian coworker tells me that she quite likes the winters here, doesn’t even mind the cold, because in ukraine the winter is deliriously gray. i remember reading in 2020 that moscow received only a few hours of sunlight in the entire month of december. i know the dangers of comparing miseries, but in this moment i feel a new gratitude at the vibrancy of the winter sky, a blue somehow sharp and incisive, unlike the bulbous languor of summer blue.

*winter sky and prospect park*

lately, i’ve been taking a special pleasure in tidiness. perhaps this seems strange, and i’ll admit that i’m trying to discover myself if it’s a pathology. but i want it to be just a simple pleasure. how nice it is to put my objects in their rightful spots, to fill my space with little precious moments. a vase my love gave to me, a bodhisattva from kathmandu, some dried flowers i picked up on the street i now live on, before i ever moved here. winter is a special season for tidiness, because things ice over and calcify. summertime means rot, overgrowth, dandelions in the cracks of the concrete. in winter, i tide and i tidy.

i’m letting myself dream in this space i’ve made for dreaming.

making spaces for dreaming — now that’s a worthy goal. but worthy of what, i wonder? worth is such a fraught term, too often an exercise of power more than a statement of earnest value. i want to make spaces for dreaming because i have felt myself just how meaningful it is to feel safe, to feel connection, to feel like you can imagine a future *and then go do it.*

yesterday, i left my job early to go to the natural history museum. i simply wanted to go, so i did. i spent a long hour in the mineral exhibit, letting my mind float and wander and get captivated by the extreme shapes and colors, the stones more closely resembling a 3d rendering than a sight from everyday life. in the exhibit, i let my eyes soften, my mind unfocus. i put on some ambient music to drown out the european tourists, and bear witness to my attention as it shifts through the space, letting it take me wherever it wants.

*i want to Eat It*

afterwards, i take a nap in the library. i worry that the security guard is going to come over and wake me up, so i strategically position a book on my lap, make it seem as though i just got sleepy while i was reading. it’s not so far from the truth, anyways, and why do i feel the need to police myself for needing some rest?

hanging out in my room, olivia and i talk about the imaginative worlds we used to inhabit. i used to make up entire alternative world cup outcomes, play each and every game (including qualifying) from the foyer in my family’s house. has that spirit of imagination left me? but we are still dreaming, and together now. sometimes they are more rooted in the real than they used to be, but we dream nonetheless. so let me excuse myself, as the bombs temporarily stop in gaza and the latest fascist prepares to take office and my unhoused neighbors shiver in the cold, and let it be the time for dreaming.
