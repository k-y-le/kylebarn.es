at the park today i walk by a woman watching tennis with her cat. the cat is wearing a sweater, a light pink with white fur trim, so that it resembles the daughter of a russian oligarch.<span>&nbsp; </span>the park is busy today, at 3:30pm, with parents walking their children home from school and dog walkers and old women power walking and a boxing class at the top of the hill.




winter light can be harsh and incisive as it cuts across the sky, as opposed to the languid ooze of a summer sunbeam. even with our part of the earth at this seasonally oblique angle, i can feel the power of the sun, as i emerge from a shaded wood into direct sunlight and feel the immediate warmth upon my cheeks. one of the reasons i love winter so much is the sparseness of it all. i notice and appreciate sunlight more attentively, when made aware of my feelings of withdrawal at its lack.




and lack it has, after an overcast week of days seemingly melting into one another. light provides heat in its agitation of molecules, and i&rsquo;m reminded that agitation is often a good thing, a shaking up. how dreadful, uniformity.


as i walk by the cat in the park, i notice how in the light its eyes are illuminated as a piercing green that feels cartoonish, almost. agitation via radiation coaxes out color, as i know in regards to my own eyes, which take on a hazel hue in natural lighting. i like this about myself, that my eyes don&rsquo;t reveal themselves unless in the right setting. i pride myself in having hidden aspects, such as the true coloring of my eyes, which only emerge in certain moments. part of the fun of living is remixing the conditions of being, such that you surprise yourself (and others) at what emerges.


i take a few pictures of the light during my walk in the park. there&rsquo;s the gradient membrane between shadow and sun on the monument. a blurry depiction of the planetree&rsquo;s off-white bark shimmering in late afternoon sun. the interplay between said planetree and it&rsquo;s neighbor, an elm, as a sort of yin and yang of competition and collaboration for the light. the voice of emily sprague, as florist, lingers in my ears. <i>see, i&rsquo;m just floating in the light // i thought that i saw the other side // but it was only sunlight in my eyes</i>
