one of the primary phrases on my dream board that hangs above the reading chair in my room is "i want my life to be a series of experiments."  experimentation really feels right; i don't have things figured out, and never want to pretend like i do. i experiment with collaboration, with gathering, with reflecting, with artmaking, with writing. this commitment is why, i think, i find myself engaged in so many projects.
one such project is one i want to share today, because i'm excited about it, and because i want to get the word out to folks who may be interested. olivia and i are teaching a class called becoming creature this fall -- it's not through any particular institution, but rather an experiment in making something without clear parameters themselves. we're calling it a pedagogical experiment, because we're also novice instructors, as much learners as the participants in the class will be. one of the wonderful things about this life is you can just do something. you don't need permission, you can just do it. if i want to learn something, i can just teach a class about it. actually, it's not that hard!
well, it's a bit hard. questions abound as we shape the structure of our upcoming course. and so i write asking for a few things, to aid this experiment in its journey towards success: will you share the details of the class with any interested friends who are nyc based? will you offer any resources or references that connect with the theme, that speak to creatureliness, whether specific or general? i'm grateful, with exciting things upcoming. til then, i'll be in the park with my toes in the grass and hands full of dirt.

When you last kissed a worm, were you surprised by your alikeness?
Becoming Creature is a 7-session, in-person course on creatureliness. Why become a creature? Because you already are one.
Matter and mind meet in this embodied exploration of nature-based ideologies. You will body-forth into a range of field trips (intellectual, cosmic, or otherwise) of creature worlds. Readings and rituals will help us carve an intimate cavity between old and new, culminating in your very own creature practice. We hope you might join our tender community & first pedagogical experiment together!  Olivia & Kyle

Classes will explore the creaturely forms of: body, knowing, metamorphosis, interdependence, technology, and ritual.
