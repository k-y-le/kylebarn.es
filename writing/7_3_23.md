i&rsquo;ve recently found a new favorite tree in my local park. this feels momentous; i don&rsquo;t know how to share it with people, or who to share it with, but i feel like i want to have a celebration. tree party. i think an important priority in my life these days is finding out how and with whom to hold these little precious moments. it is so joyous to share who you are with the world, but it is a challenge to find people who will match your energy when it comes to properly acknowledging the joys. certain people just bring an &ldquo;i will frolic in the park with you&rdquo; energy that can be hard to come by! i hope that i convey that energy to some folks, though i think i often come off as serious and reserved. but i&rsquo;ve been hugging trees!


deciding on a favorite tree means really contemplating what the tree is, and how it lives in the world. i&rsquo;ve been thinking about the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-secrets-of-the-wood-wide-web" >wood wide web</a>, which transfixed me when i first heard about it, but has somehow lost its luster, to me, as a concept. some part of it has to do with its popularity, the place it has taken in stoner culture of like &ldquo;wow nature is so crazy.. did you know trees can talk?&rdquo; but also i&rsquo;ve been feeling really disillusioned with that which elevates an ecological concept or speculative fiction as a panacea, or something that will save us. i know that people aren&rsquo;t actually being so reductive, but it feels like it, and i don&rsquo;t like it! my issue with&nbsp;<em >Ministry for the Future</em>&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t necessarily the content, or Kim Stanley Robinson&rsquo;s poor quality writing (imo), but the way that it was received, the lauding it as a&nbsp;<a href="https://jacobin.com/2020/12/kim-stanley-robinson-ministry-for-the-future" >massively important work of fiction</a>&nbsp;because of its promise of political responsibility. the trees aren&rsquo;t talking because they want to show us that a better world is possible; they&rsquo;re talking because that&rsquo;s how they live, it&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;ve always lived.


does this mean i&rsquo;m too attuned to public opinion? i don&rsquo;t think i&rsquo;m someone who tends to be particularly swayed by what scenes are doing or whatnot, but i do think that i care when it comes to something like ecology. it&rsquo;s because i&rsquo;m really not in it for my own enjoyment or consumption, i&rsquo;m in it for living well together. emphasis on the together.


my favorite tree stands alone in a patch of grass, surrounded on all four sides by concrete paths. it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s lonely; the park is full of all sorts of trees (quite an artificial diversity&hellip; sounds familiar). in my mind the concrete extends forever, all the way into the earth&rsquo;s core, isolating my tree from its neighbors, cutting off the mycelium networks that might make communication possible through the ground (they can, of course, still release pheromones so it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s in solitary confinement). i know cognitively that the concrete is only so thick, that under it is soil, bedrock, aquifers, maybe some fossils. but for some reason i can&rsquo;t get the image out of my head &mdash; all the concrete we&rsquo;ve used to pave over the natural world, extending deep into the core.

<span class="caption">i don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on here but i&#39;m just not gonna listen</span>

no under, no over, the flatness of life in 2023. unable to look past the surface, only acknowledging that which makes itself known. information overload, concrete overload, wood wide web overload. i&rsquo;m thinking about wildlife corridors. i feel as though wildlife corridors, spaces deliberately cleared of human development (most notably, roads) such that animals can migrate with limited threat of getting run over or shot, confirms my imagining of the world as a flat jigsaw puzzle of concrete and nature. it&rsquo;s like those dystopian fictions that pop up every couple years or so where the future world has been cordoned off into hyper-dense concrete wastelands and hyper-lush natural environments. but one young defiant soul unknowingly stumbles upon the secret, that this world they were sold as necessary to save biodiversity is actually just a tool for souped up uber-elite class politics. using their precocious combat skills and superior empathy, they crack the code and struggle to dismantle the carceral elite and open up the world&rsquo;s gardens to the common folk. huzzah!


it&rsquo;s part of this move in dystopian fiction to examine our world by constructing a hyperbolic binary. you&rsquo;re either in the garden or the city. either rich or poor. either divergent or boring. but life just needs space to move, to migrate. the most compelling stories to me, recently, have been those which move, too. i think the lousiest fiction is that which entices me with a purportedly thoughtful question, only to disappoint me with its crass binary politics and obvious resolutions. i can&rsquo;t look away, as it&rsquo;s so easy to be drawn in by the simplistic superhero politics.


i imagine wildlife corridors as ribbons of life extending across the world, like long tears in the map. here there be wildlife. elsewhere, concrete foreverness. 1.5% of the continental US is covered by impermeable surfaces such as concrete, 14% of the coastlines. Adrienne Buller: &ldquo;Two million dollars. That is the value of a great whale, as calculated in 2019 by researchers from the International Monetary Fund. The value is based on the species&#39; contribution to ecotourism and how much carbon dioxide it can capture and sequester&hellip; What if we eventually decide that humanity can no longer afford two million dollars per whale?&rdquo; how much does a wildlife corridor cost? how much does it save?


these numbers feel important, in that if i were convincing someone of the value of this proposal i would put them in a pitch deck. i would use a subtle yet environmentally evocative color scheme, lots of greens and tans, maybe some rust colored highlights for emphasis. i would appeal to the emotional side but bolster that with rationality. reel them in, then convince them with numbers and logic. this is, of course, how everything gets done. how much does my favorite tree cost? yesterday, i put my hand on its trunk and felt like we were communing.


in&nbsp;<em >Pure Colour</em>&nbsp;by Sheila Heti, Mira spends a while as a leaf, communing with her recently deceased father. while in the leaf, she uses her position (unable to move, be active) to essentially annoy her father into talking to her. it works, for a while, but when a former almost-love walks by she ends up returning to the human world. later, she shows up at said former almost-love&rsquo;s house dressed as a leaf. human, this time, but covered in green paint and wearing a DIY costume. the almost-love rejects her, brusquely asks her to leave, dealing a blow to Mira, as she realizes the extent to which she is not understood by those she is close to. it&rsquo;s a metaphor, it&rsquo;s magical realism, it&rsquo;s a bit of inspiration, i suppose. though i love this body too much to let it go. and i&rsquo;m still constrained enough by society to keep me from walking around in full leaf attire.

<span class="caption">one of the first google image results for &quot;leaf costume&quot; .. i kinda get it bc if someone showed up to my house looking like this i would also get them to leave as quickly as possible</span>

maybe the end of the world will be pitch decks and spreadsheets. information workers like myself still plotting our way out of the mess, coming up with wildlife corridor 2.0, while others wander around dressed as leaves. how am i going to profit? convince the stakeholders? track the metrics of success? the planet on fire poses a great opportunity to collect more data. maybe we make our concrete sequester carbon, then we can keep drifting towards dystopia.


i have a compulsion that i take maybe a bit too far. it&rsquo;s a fear of optimization. i refuse to track my steps, my distance, my calories burned. to me, it feels like a betrayal, to exercise for the sake of a number. track my way to fitness. i worry that our metrics-obsessed culture is rotting my mind, that if i let the numbers in, there won&rsquo;t be space in my brain for these precious moments. that i&rsquo;ll put my hand on my favorite tree and think only of carbon offsets. i see a whale and i see a pricetag.


i&rsquo;m worried about my favorite tree. i think it will wither and die, or i will die first, or we&rsquo;ll both die, or we&rsquo;ll be washed away in a flood, or a flood will come and i&rsquo;ll get advance notice to evacuate but who is going to tell the tree? maybe it knows but can&rsquo;t do anything, and what a horror that is, to stand tall upon the hill of your life and stare down the end, knowing that you had nothing to do with it, and can do nothing about it. maybe it&rsquo;s noble, maybe my tree will become a martyr, but i worry about that too &mdash; that we live in a world so oversaturated with martyrs. i&rsquo;m tired of martyrdom, i&rsquo;m tired of smoke filled skies, i&rsquo;m tired of concrete that goes on forever, on wildlife corridors and two million dollar whales. i&rsquo;m tired of borders and sea walls that might not work and islands that are jails.


Deborah Levy: &ldquo;Life falls apart. We try to get a grip and hold it together. And then we realize we don&#39;t want to hold it together.&rdquo; i&rsquo;m trying to figure out what to hold onto, and what to let fall apart. i think i&rsquo;ll always be figuring it out. that living is mostly about the pursuit of figuring it out.


i&rsquo;ve recently started keeping a list of things that i love (thank you suraya for the inspiration). moments, experiences, precious things. these are the pieces of my life i want to hold onto, i want to seek out, to nurture. now i&rsquo;m going to go to the park and lay under my favorite tree. it&rsquo;s a small something, but it&rsquo;s mine.
