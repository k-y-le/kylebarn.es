hi! it&#39;s august and i&#39;ve been picking up my melted parts. some thinking on nostalgia and irony below, but first, a quick ask. i&#39;ve recently wrapped up writing my first essay for a magazine and really enjoyed the process! i&#39;d like to keep exploring writing in this way.. if anyone reading has advice for pitching writing, developing relationships with editors, places i should look into writing for, anything at all, please let me know! or if you just wanna chat, that&#39;s cool too :D

i&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about nostalgia. about how sometimes the desire to live in the past is so palpable that it feels like time is slipping through my fingers. there&rsquo;s no doubt that nostalgia has a certain currency in today&rsquo;s culture. maybe it&rsquo;s because of the threat of an impending recession. or part of it is due to a longing for a time when there was more of a sense of shared culture than our fragmented digital media consumption habits allow. for me, i&rsquo;ve found myself listening to vampire weekend&rsquo;s eponymous debut album.


reading&nbsp;<a href="https://pioneerworks.org/broadcast/vampire-weekend-preppy-colonialism" >earth music by ricky sallay zoker</a>&nbsp;opens up new avenues for thinking about the confluence of cultural influences in a song like cape cod kwassa kwassa. it&rsquo;s something that i, frankly, have never really given much thought before. it&rsquo;s exhausting to be constantly critiquing and analyzing everything you consume, and when i first came upon vampire weekend (something like 2011? i think), i&rsquo;m not sure i had even heard the word colonialism more than a couple times in passing.


i think nostalgia is about illusions &mdash; of what the past was and what the present is. i hold illusions about what vampire weekend meant to me, what it means now.


my relationship with vampire weekend&rsquo;s music, particularly their early music, is that of somewhat identification. this is, actually, how i feel about most music, since it&rsquo;s quite rare that i find something that really speaks to me. and actually sounds good. listening to campus by vampire weekend in 2011, i would imagine myself strolling through an idyllic ivy league campus, musing on my unrequited love and the drama of my upcoming trip to cape cod. fast forward to 2018, and suddenly i was actually strolling through an idyllic ivy league campus, but somehow it never fit quite right. maybe because i&rsquo;m missing the cape cod aspect (if anyone wants to take me out on the cape and show me what it&rsquo;s really about, hml). part of me thought that going to princeton would catapult me into the new england wasp cachet. but, it turns out, the vast majority of my friends (and myself) didn&rsquo;t feel really at home on that campus; our problems were much more material than ezra koenig&rsquo;s lyrics allude to.

<span class="caption">i thought this was going to be my life but turns out those people are really lame</span>

to me, the appeal of vampire weekend&rsquo;s music is that it&rsquo;s extremely catchy, first of all, and that it touches on a kind of carefree way of going about the world. it&rsquo;s loose ralph lauren shirts and day drinking on a wednesday. it&rsquo;s reading kant on a lawn while my mind wanders to think about who i&rsquo;ll see at the party tonight. elements of this really do touch on the absurd sociality of attending a school like princeton. and i see this kind of carefree attitude in many of my peers, particularly those who actually do have summer homes and private school backgrounds. it always felt like this could be attainable for me, and maybe it still could be, but i&rsquo;m much more interested in living deeply in the world.


i&rsquo;ve grown out of vampire weekend, since my early infatuation in middle and high school. in some ways the band has grown with me, and an album like modern vampires of the city feels like it reflects my own path of graduating from my ivy league school to work and live in nyc. but i think part of why i no longer feel as strongly attached to a song like cape cod kwassa kwassa is because i&rsquo;ve seen it for what it is: a nostalgic illusion. i came close, but vampire weekend&rsquo;s world was never going to be for me. and while they position themselves as ironically exploring the tensions between colonialism and elite white spaces, the irony just doesn&rsquo;t bypass the tension of intellectually leveraging afro-pop to legendary success. i&rsquo;m not sure it ever did.


in&nbsp;<em >eating the other</em>, bell hooks writes about imperialist nostalgia, and the ways that it implicitly motivates the consumption of non-white or &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; cultures by white elites as a sort of pre-emption of racism allegations. it&rsquo;s also no coincidence that hooks&rsquo; starts her essay with an anecdote about white jocks at yale; the academy is a superb setting for this kind of consumption, with its cultivated diversity and intellectual prestige.<em ><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85);">&nbsp;</span>see, we&rsquo;re not racist, we honored west african traditional music by using it in our song!</em>


does vampire weekend consume the other by leaning on imperialist nostalgia? i think so, at least somewhat. so then why does a song like cape cod kwassa kwassa still hold up? i think the answer here has to do with the ironic, intellectual engagement. these days, many people are still eating the other, but what i see more often is a kind of &ldquo;inviting the other to dinner and serving them their own cultural food.&rdquo; it really came to the fore in the 2020 instagram infographic craze (which i still find one of the most fascinating cultural moments of my lifetime). white guilt has become so metabolized into our culture that there&rsquo;s a sense that we white people must prove that we aren&rsquo;t racist, that we have Black friends, that we read&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85);">how to be anti-racist</span>&nbsp;and took notes, see. in doing so, this form of what i&rsquo;m calling&nbsp;<em >feeding the other</em>&nbsp;also places a burden on said other, who now is being asked to serve as cultural arbiter of who is good or bad, without a particularly meaningful change in their agency, as the inherent racism in our social organization remains largely intact. feeding the other still centers whiteness. it&rsquo;s still more about the topical cape cod elite than it is about the west african rhythms that hold it up.


in response to my own alienation from the stifling uniformity of american suburbanism, i try on something new. vampire weekend tried on afro-pop, i tried on vampire weekend. when that didn&rsquo;t deliver, when my princeton experience didn&rsquo;t match the stories i imagined, i try on something new. a core problem with whiteness is that it&rsquo;s always about trying something on. looking outside to fill a hole that&rsquo;s missing inside. that&rsquo;s how it goes when your identity is predicated on the exclusion of others. but that&rsquo;s the thing, right? white people love Black music. how many rappers have threatened to quit playing shows because there are too many white people in their crowds?


decentering whiteness from my life is an ongoing process. i&rsquo;ll admit that i get tired of constantly interrogating everything i consume, constantly trying to make clear that my consumption comes from a place of respect. at this point it&rsquo;s tired to say that there&rsquo;s no such thing as ethical consumption under capitalism. but it&rsquo;s true, and under racial capitalism in particular. the fantasy of being a perfect consumer of non-white music is another illusion undergirded by imperialist nostalgia. but i do think that there are ways to push back against eating the other, or feeding the other. probably the most important part of this resistance is always asking ourselves if we&rsquo;re centering whiteness. the music of some of my favorite artists isn&rsquo;t about me. that doesn&rsquo;t mean i can&rsquo;t enjoy it, draw attention to it, and funnel money into it. but it does mean that i shouldn&rsquo;t be making demands of how it or the artist creating it should make me feel, or interact with their audience.


there are certain feelings that come alongside being a white person in progressive and largely nonwhite spaces, which i think tend to go under-acknowledged. one is pride, when being recognized for having a diverse friend group. another is envy, directed towards the way that nonwhite voices are elevated in these spaces. perhaps most prominent is shame, about the ways that we benefit from historic injustice, and the ways that the benefits feel good. i&rsquo;ll readily admit that i feel these things, with the caveat that i try not to let them dictate how i act in these spaces; i don&rsquo;t want to center my whiteness. i just think it&rsquo;s useful to recognize that these are feelings that come up. i&rsquo;m not just the &ldquo;good&rdquo; white person. i also think recognizing these feelings allows for more compassion for the ways that white people slip up, intentionally or unintentionally. adrienne marie brown: &ldquo;i will not be perfect, i will keep learning. i will also not be silent, i will keep learning&rdquo;


something that&rsquo;s come up in a few conversations i&rsquo;ve had this week is the way that i tend to get along with everybody. if some people are kiki, i&rsquo;m bouba &mdash; i&rsquo;m soft, rounded, malleable to the needs of others and always navigating my way to a point of agreeableness. i don&rsquo;t think this is a flaw or something i want to change, but i do think it contributes to the dissonance i feel between the way i live my life and the narratives dominant in our culture. some of the malaise i&rsquo;ve been feeling lately has its origins in a desire i see in myself to be embroiled in a dramatic conflict.


what to do about this? i have two intentions. one is to continue to seek out the drama and beauty in life as it is. i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s healthy to seek out conflict with other people, and i think it&rsquo;s myopic to believe that the drama and beauty of life is only or primarily to be found in interpersonal conflict or romantic entanglements. so i&rsquo;m dramatizing the way that i just saw a bee eating (?) the wing of a smushed spotted lanternfly. i&rsquo;m dramatizing the fireflies&rsquo; luminescence at dusk. i&rsquo;m dramatizing my bike rides through tree-lined brooklyn streets.

<span class="caption">actually this is the most dramatic thing to happen in my life in weeks... i&#39;m still reeling...</span>

the second intention is to avoid and critique the ways that this feeling (desire for dramatic conflict coupled with the instability of whiteness in an increasingly diverse culture) manifests in harmful or at least uncaring ways. this is how you get things like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/peter-thiel-anti-woke-film-festival-trevor-bazile">Peter Thiel funded anti-woke Dimes Square film festival</a>&nbsp;(cursed series of words). the desire to be edgy which fuels ironic anti-wokeness is bedfellows with the precarity of whiteness and competition for intention in a media-saturated culture. it&rsquo;s silly, it&rsquo;s ridiculous, i have no patience for it. but it&rsquo;s coming from somewhere. a critique of the ways that this irony permeates the public sphere and has material effects (lots of money flows in the lower east side) should foreground the desire fueling it, and ask how it could be different. a careful interrogation of the feelings of nostalgia and irony opens up new ideas for living well.
