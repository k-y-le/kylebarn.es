it&rsquo;s spring and i&rsquo;m undone. i&rsquo;m writing this sitting in the tea house at the japanese garden in the brooklyn botanic gardens. it&rsquo;s a chilly spring morning. i hear horns honking in the distance (i live in new york city), there is a haitian family loudly exclaiming at the beauty of the cherry blossoms (i live in new york city). beneath me, koi fish do whatever the fish equivalent of pacing back and forth is, my very presence the promise of food i cannot deliver on.


recently, i&rsquo;ve been feeling overwhelmed. i told louison that it feels like my head is overflowing. i&rsquo;m someone who prides themselves on retaining a depth of knowledge and for some reason i&rsquo;m constantly compelled to add more &mdash; to excavate the workings of the world. there are aspects of my life that are left to the wayside: texts i haven&rsquo;t responded to in weeks, taxes unfiled, bags unpacked for an imminent trip to brazil. it feels like a crisis of care. that is, i don&rsquo;t know how to care for myself if i can&rsquo;t care for the world.


in spring i feel like possibility hangs thick in the air. i&rsquo;m walking around and suddenly aware that everyone and everything around me is going somewhere, for something. there&rsquo;s a word for this, i think (the internet says sonder, which was made up by an author and is also the name of a airbnb adjacent business, both of which i must admit i&rsquo;m a bit disappointed by). i never feel it so strongly as when i go to the park and picnic blankets splatter across the lawn. they remind me of my preoccupation with how we make sense of the inexorable absurdity of the world. of the systems that we are made to understand as responsible for our lives. of the ways that capitalism and colonialism and patriarchy manifest in our lives. at times, this feels incongruous with the simple satisfaction of sonder (sondering?). but, also, i recognize in my recognition of others a way to acknowledge and accept the overwhelmingness of being alive in 2023. i walk around my new neighborhood and pet someone&rsquo;s dog. i buy a cup of soup at the farmers&rsquo; market. i pick up a fallen cherry blossom and put it behind my ear.

<span class="caption">it&rsquo;s like. who gave you the right to be this pink??</span>

i keep living with this dissonance. i keep looking at the beautiful, vast world and thinking about the terrible, vast world. i don&rsquo;t want to let these feelings go, because i think that is how we&rsquo;re supposed to respond, how we&rsquo;re made inert and passive as these systems and the powerful people behind them stifle our imagination. but also i need to pack for my trip like right now. it sometimes feels like i have internalized this false dichotomy between having a stake in the world and doing the things that must get done. if i let the stakes of living wash over me, i can be really productive. but when i pause to look around and take stock of what&rsquo;s happening, suddenly everything has passed and i&rsquo;m behind on every deadline i didn&rsquo;t know i had. i don&rsquo;t think these are the only two options, so i&rsquo;ve been trying to identify the tactics i and others use to keep ourselves from catching on the troubles as they come at us, in the name of productivity or otherwise. those things i tell myself to keep me from really being&nbsp;<em><strong><strong>in it,</strong></strong></em>&nbsp;in the thick of living right here with all of us tangled up in the end of the world.


one i&rsquo;ve been thinking of a lot recently is something i&rsquo;ve been referring to as the &ldquo;yikes&rdquo; phenomenon. i think of it as the way that, when confronted with a fact about the systemic issues in the world, a common response is something along the lines of saying &ldquo;yikes&rdquo; and moving on. the word yikes itself is not necessary, but emblematic, i think, of an acknowledgement of harm without taking an action or continuing the conversation. it&rsquo;s a way to signal being &ldquo;on the right side&rdquo; and against whatever harm is occurring, but absolving oneself of the impetus to take action or even take on responsibility.


at a dinner party i spend a few minutes talking about my concerns that the current anti-trans panic signifies a general backlash against the increasing instability of normative power structures and someone sighs, shakes their head, and says &ldquo;it&rsquo;s such a shame&rdquo;. at a work lunch a coworker explains to me how her university invited war criminals to speak at a public policy conference and i say &ldquo;that&rsquo;s so unfortunate&rdquo;. when the world feels so overwhelmingly full of conflict and difficulty, it makes sense to &ldquo;yikes&rdquo; and move on &mdash; we&rsquo;ve all got things to do and many of us are just trying to get by.


still, i can&rsquo;t help but feel dissatisfied. by myself, when i refuse to (or don&rsquo;t know how) to engage with a topic. by others, when they don&rsquo;t match my energetic pontificating about what is to be done. it feels to me as though, when faced with systems so complicated and so overwhelming, we should meet them with anger, emotion, and action far more than we currently do. what i&rsquo;m expressing is, i suppose, a frustration with apathy and cool irony, when the world we&rsquo;re living in is so vibrant and full of possibility (it&rsquo;s spring and i&rsquo;m undone). so i&rsquo;ve been trying to call out the &ldquo;yikes&rdquo; phenomenon when i see it (in myself and in media, i&rsquo;m too afraid of being a buzzkill to call out other people yet). we&rsquo;ll see how it goes.


recently i saw&nbsp;<em>Sick of Myself<strong>,</strong></em>&nbsp;a Norwegian film about a narcissistic pathological liar who takes a mysterious Russian drug in order to give herself a skin disease so she can get attention from her narcissistic kleptomaniac contemporary artist boyfriend. there are a lot of words here; mostly, the film is about her doing ridiculous things for attention (we are supposed to laugh but also feel anxious as she does so). the characters are pretty flat, in my opinion, but i was interested in it as a satirical take (no clue if this was intended) on this genre of ironic self-defeating millenialism.&nbsp;<em>Normal People, My Year of Rest &amp; Relaxation, The Worst Person in the World</em>&nbsp;(which&nbsp;<em>Sick of Myself</em>&nbsp;is enough in conversation with to have a feature from lead actor Anders Danielsen Lie). it&rsquo;s these narratives with a late-twenties, female, usually white, middle or upper class main character who can&rsquo;t seem to figure her shit out. she&rsquo;s always unhappy, owing to her dissatisfying sex life or unmoored self-destructive behavior. if i&rsquo;m going to be dramatic about it, i&rsquo;d call it an aesthetic of white liberal petulance &mdash; a glamorization of evading responsibility and claiming an innocence that forecloses the acknowledgement of their role in class society.

<span class="caption">she&rsquo;s kinda iconic for this but also soooooo annoying</span>

anyways, i think that this genre really exemplifies the &ldquo;yikes&rdquo; phenomenon. what is there to hope for when you&rsquo;re young, white, skinny, and rich living in a cosmopolitan city? actually, i think, there&rsquo;s a lot more to hope for than the atomized millenial search for meaning of this genre. it&rsquo;s all connected to a shared feeling of alienation or anomie that i think really does impact the young professional information worker class, manifesting in boring gentrified neighborhoods and boring forms of overconsumption increasingly reliant upon a growing gig worker precariat. the yuppie class is a powerful subset of people, and one that i happen to be a part of.


i feel like people have been complaining about apathy forever, and any historian could come up with some example of someone in the time period they study lecturing about how people just don&rsquo;t care enough, or about the right things. but i do think that a general attitude of defeatism is something that i can and should resist as much as i can. it&rsquo;s not just about getting people excited about the same things as me (though i hope it happens&hellip; few things as fun as realizing shared excitement&hellip; intoxicating&hellip;), but also about building a network and community of people that don&rsquo;t just say yikes and move on, but really stick with it, stay with the trouble, and come live this beautiful overwhelming demanding life together.


anyways, i finished writing this on my flight, and suddenly i&rsquo;m in s&atilde;o paulo! if anyone has any recommendations, please let me know â˜»
