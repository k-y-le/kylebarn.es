happy april folks â˜» i&rsquo;m moving into a new apartment tomorrow (come say hi if you find yourself in fort greene or aren&#39;t there but wanna say hi anyways), i&rsquo;m doing my first art residency next week in s&atilde;o paulo, and it&rsquo;s 87&nbsp;degrees in new york city! most used emoji this week: ðŸ˜µ&zwj;ðŸ’«


something i&rsquo;ve learned about east coast weather is that there&rsquo;s usually these few days in march or april where the fact of the changing seasons blows me away. suddenly it&rsquo;s warm (or hot) and sticky and everything is blooming and everyone is looking around moving their bodies and it feels like time sped up, all of a sudden. someone pressed 2x on the playback speed of life. every year it happens and i feel unprepared, stripped of my winter ironies i felt so sure would last, burning bright with the joy of spring. suddenly i&rsquo;m blooming.


the word blooming gets a lot of attention these days, conceptually. zines and instagram posts explain how octavia butler&rsquo;s fiction helps us see what we need to bloom and offer motivational phrases fresh with canva&rsquo;s latest styles. blooming has a certain currency in left, queer, alternative discourses, which integrate it seamlessly into in vogue ecofeminist concepts of interdependence, speculation, and a romanticization&nbsp;of subsistence lifestyles. of course, at the same time it proliferates amongst white millenial and gen X christian-core aesthetics, cursive script and all. this is a common but still exciting tension i enjoy seeing play out, even as it forces me to lose my commitment to the thing that originally comepelled me (right now, it&rsquo;s mushrooms that have, to me, most recently undergone this consumption and regurgitation by popular culture). still, i think it&rsquo;s really useful, often, to name what we want. we want to bloom.

that&rsquo;s essentially what jonathan said to me on wednesday, that he didn&rsquo;t realize he was getting so pessimistic, this late into the winter. spring sunshine reminded him about how he wasn&rsquo;t making as much space for joy as he wants. as he needs to bloom. we planned to do some gardening and host an open-mic. and maybe a trip to montreal.


raya and i hosted <a class="notion-link-token notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" href="http://tomorrowsoup.com/" >a soup time</a> recently, called&nbsp;<em>In Found Soil, In Order to Bloom</em><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;which approached the question of blooming&nbsp;from the perspective of the soil that begets said blooming. we spent time upside down, searched for trinkets in a pile of soil, released ladybugs on the kale bush, and did some thinking together about what soil we need to find ourselves in, in order to bloom. how do we want to grow? what changes do we need to make to get there? i found this soup time really generative (as did others, i hope) in particular for how it made space for being weird.


i&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the importance of doing weird things. i don&rsquo;t use that word lightly, and really mean weird in terms of an &quot;outside&quot; happening, which &quot;lies beyond standard perception, cognition, and experience&quot; as Mark Fisher puts it in his book&nbsp;<em>The Weird and the Eerie</em>. it is&nbsp;that which, despite our directly experiencing it, defies our ability to fit into our neatly organized categories, and therefore calls into question the assumptions that undergird our precious categories.&nbsp;to me it&rsquo;s important to be precise about the what and why of weirdness, otherwise it begins to feel self-aggrandizing. weird should have a politics, too.

spring means i experience the public sphere more often, in that i spend more time outside and there are more people around when and where i do. it&rsquo;s not something i have much of a choice in, though i can always avoid it by staying in. i don&rsquo;t stay in; i find it to be one of the inescapable joys of living in a pedestrian-oriented city. (this part is important - while it feels like spring every other week in LA, i rarely feel like i&rsquo;m part of the public when there)


spring also means more opportunities to disarm the norms of the public, of what being in public can be. some of this takes the form of spring rowdiness &mdash; loud music, acting out, <a class="notion-link-token notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" href="https://phys.org/news/2022-06-gun-violence-spikes-weather.html" >increasing gun violence</a>.&nbsp;but i&rsquo;m more interested in the ways we can disrupt normative socializing in public towards more tender, more interdependent actions. things that disrupt, but in ways that forego irony and post-irony to face the issue of how we live together, head-on. that which prompts us to contend with how we are all implicated in the construction of the public space we enjoy.


recently i described my art practice, and more specifically <a class="notion-link-token notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0" href="https://www.kylebarn.es/performances.html" >my performance practice</a>&nbsp;as engaging people in simple actions that aim to destabilize how we think about and respond to the complex overwhelming systems of late capitalism. it can be a bit much to intellectualize something like a planned group hug, but i also think that treating this form of performance seriously means questioning how much we define art as that which shocks, which claims a great theoretical basis, or otherwise leans on irony and satire. if art speaks to our current moment, it should speak to the yearning for connection that, to me, is most emblematic of individuated late-stage capitalist experience (a good example that&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><a class="notion-link-token notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="1" href="https://www.bkmag.com/2023/03/31/at-faurschou-a-time-hopping-exhibit-thats-also-an-embrace/" >up now at Faurschou</a>&nbsp;is &ldquo;Embrace the World from Within&rdquo; &mdash; thank you neiman for the recommendation!).

this is all fine. it&rsquo;s fine and important to have critical and ironic art, but i do wonder if responding to most/all examples of tenderness with wanton skepticism signals a giving-in to the hardening ironic sheen of neoliberalism (this is a problem i generally have with the ironic leftist theory bro type. like&hellip; why are you wearing your irony like armor&hellip;). we have to be weak hearted in order to connect with one another, to build community. we have to be soft.


i was thinking about this yesterday at a climate event in midtown, a book and app launch rolled into one, in which dani and i ate some kelp snacks and signed some pledges. we also generally reflected on our ambivalence towards the effectiveness of these initiatives.


i believe that building a movement requires these awkward moments when you realize that a lot of the work happening is not very effective (to you, and generally), a lot of the work is not very cool (to you, and generally), and the work being done is still extremely important, and still to be celebrated. bounding too fast into the question of &ldquo;to critique or not to critique?&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t worth my time, so i like to leave it at that. to say that critique is enough but to only critique is not enough. we have to do little things and stand up tall and look at the other people suddenly outside in the heavy spring air and say this is the public and this is what i care about. i want us to thrive, together, to bloom. i know we can.


on wednesday i also watched the new documentary:&nbsp;<em>Nam June Paik: Moon is the Oldest TV</em>&nbsp;(what a terrific title) and couldn&rsquo;t stop wondering about what has changed when it comes to making it as an artist in new york city. or generally, i suppose, though i&rsquo;m most familiar with the new york case. there are lots of reasons why it&rsquo;s different now. different grant procedures, market saturation, diminishing funding sources, social media branding, neoliberal self-entrepreneurship (the Etsyfication of the art world?).


but at the same time i&rsquo;m particularly interested in the differences in social ties amongst the avant-garde art scene of downtown nyc in the 70s/80s. things feels more fractured, porous now. unable to hold shape long enough to get a good look. dispersed amongst a proliferation of corners of the online and offline world. sometimes it feels like inundation by creativity. <a class="notion-link-token notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="1" href="https://reallifemag.com/taking-stock/">we&rsquo;re all Creators now</a>.&nbsp;everyone&rsquo;s so creative, and polished, and they have insitution buy-in from somewhere while retaining their cool independent charm, a charm that also wards away the (implied) flood of other artists rushing to snatch up the shreds of institutional funding or clout left in their wake. yes i&#39;m jealous!!!


i guess it&rsquo;s generally a sign of the decline in arts funding, alongside increasing cost-of-living. in a system that punishes those outside traditional labor hierarchies by withholding or overpricing necessities or quality of life improvements, what is the result? our current techno-dystopia. at dinner on tuesday an HCI professor told me that one of the best places to look for funding for new media art is through the google real estate team. they pay really well, who cares if only google employees get to see it? money makes the soil richer.

<span class="caption">also i want to mention that i think a lot of this new media art / creative coding / ai art tends to be pretty uninspired. pursuing an aesthetic ideal without actually questioning what makes that ideal is boring, especially when tools mean you can make like, infinite copies of &ldquo;cool shapes that move&rdquo;. today i went to bitforms gallery (preview of show pictured) and thought most of the art was&hellip; ok&hellip;</span>

america is a deserved-it country. everyone either deserves it (good life) or deserves it (bad life). suspicion baked into our institutions. carceral logics proliferate. bloom, even. i see this as another reason to disturb the peace with tenderness, to show that we actually will act in ways that encourage our soft and sometimes-facile selves, when given the opportunity. we don&rsquo;t have to always be jaded and we don&rsquo;t have to always have it all figured out. i believe that a lot of us are craving some simple support or care or instruction to bring us together. that when spring strips me of my irony i should give in to my imipulse to roll around in the grass and cry because of the pollen or maybe because of the beauty of it all and regardless isn&rsquo;t it special that we share in such gorgeous terrible beauty? i stand under a magnolia tree and wipe a tear from my eye.
