it&rsquo;s just turned december, and i&rsquo;ve just told christine&rsquo;s coworker that it&rsquo;s the Mirror Month because of its reputation for reflection. i tell him to use this time as a springboard to widen the horizons of 2024, gesticulating wildly. he tells me about the time he grew magic mushrooms out of his apartment, and offers to get me another drink (i&rsquo;m not drinking). my hair is still wet from waiting out in the rain for my song to finish before heading in. especially wet because it&rsquo;s an eight-minute labyrinth of a nicolas jaar song. i think i&rsquo;m enjoying myself, here, in this red room surrounded by greenpoint designers who keep complimenting my lace collar and offering me more wine (i&rsquo;m not drinking).


december arrived without fanfare this year, drifting in under misty conditions. still, my mirrors are calibrating, my mind wandering back to the past eleven months. time is just a way to measure life. someone asks me when i got a tattoo and i blank; for about 90 seconds, the matrix of time, place, and physical sensation shatters, and i feel guilt for being unable to recall the moment that i got this unalterable drawing on my skin. but i remember, and the guilt washes away.


at a dinner party, i wonder aloud if the experience of aging is one of a smoothing over of the novel moments by which we recall our memories. one of the more compelling reasons to have a child, to me, is the way that the experience fundamentally alters your own conception of time. bringing a new creature into your life feels stark among a background of routine labor and regularity. but there are many ways to bring a creature into your life that don&rsquo;t entail a child, and besides i think the reasons for childbirth should be much more about the child than the parent. i&rsquo;ve never been one for reproductive futurity, anyways.


what has my life been, lately? what time do i use to measure it? i&rsquo;m learning to be more at ease with ease, to soak in regularity and the creativity that emerges from rootedness. i&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out how to throw parties for a living. i don&rsquo;t actually want capitalism to encroach further into this sphere of life, i just think i&rsquo;m really good at it. and i truly just want to keep having fun. i&rsquo;ve been feeling so at home in yellow blankets of fallen ginkgo leaves. i want to get paid to do this, too. which is to say, i want to live and not worry about payment. which is to say that i want to absolve myself of labor. which is to say that i have a fantasy of untethered obligation. but i&rsquo;ve been lying on the floor listening to music. and i&rsquo;ve been luxuriously eating grandiose meals for no reason other than that i can, and that i&rsquo;m doing it with my roommates who i love. that&rsquo;s the name of our groupchat. roommates who i love. and it&rsquo;s true, actually, that i love my roommates. i think they love me back.


i&rsquo;ve been wondering about territory, after a call with a spanish curator who seemed perplexed generally. not about me or what i was saying (the topic was quite simple, honestly), he just seemed like someone perpetually perplexed. he told me that my work in art + science needs to be embedded in territory. &ldquo;too much living is distributed.&rdquo; is my life embedded in the territory it is in? sometimes i feel like everyone thinks they&rsquo;re talking about place, but they&rsquo;re really just circling the question. all questions are circles, cori tells me, while we watch lesbian performance art on a vhs tv. it inspires <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6xfWjGTRx3jkVHzWnOidXx?si=79120785f340414d">a playlist,</a> which exists in the cloud. distinctly not territorial. i&rsquo;m tired of talking about territory; i don&rsquo;t talk about it enough.

all of this is land relations. at work i lead a discussion about how to do land back. actually, that&rsquo;s generous. it&rsquo;s not really a discussion, it&rsquo;s more me forcing it into conversation with a righteous tone. but i&rsquo;m no expert, i&rsquo;m just questioning, circling, asymptotically approaching something that resembles action.


i think all of us are feeling guilty, lately. not doing enough, not doing the right thing. if neoliberalism is zombified late capitalism, guilt is the blood it needs to survive. affectively, at least. there&rsquo;s also the whole monetary system thing, too.


i think i need to learn more about economics, at least so that i can more effectively write criticism, which is a lot of what motivates me these days. it&rsquo;s funny, my guilt prompting me to write criticism. my guilt about not taking action. my action being somewhat actionless. but still i&rsquo;m annoyed at most things i see for being either not political enough or too obviously political. i want something absurd, because life is absurd.


i&rsquo;m always fitting some revolution in the bounds. but that&rsquo;s not the point, like did i even read <em>the undercommons</em>? all this talking about place which is really about space, and all this talking about space when we&rsquo;re really just ignoring the place. is the surround a place or a space, or&mdash; am i a traitor the cause because i work for a billionaire, or&mdash; is there actually a mushroom at the end of the world, or&mdash; am i just being dramatic all the time?


i have dinner with a friend who spent the past year working the night shift at an amazon facility in order to organize the workers. well, she&rsquo;s not really my friend, she&rsquo;s the friend of my roommate (who i love). she tells me that 15 people got fired for stealing food when the payment mechanism wouldn&rsquo;t work. they needed to eat something to get through their eleven hour night shift. they lost their jobs.


in america, losing a job is like losing a part of yourself. it&rsquo;s something to grieve, to express heartfelt condolences, to evoke a deep sympathy. some days i want to lose my job, because i want to have something obvious to grieve and i want to be forced into a path wholly unknowable to myself. i&rsquo;m tired of having direction and living with intention, which is to say that i&rsquo;m living as intentional as ever. and it&rsquo;s really working out for me. i&rsquo;m falling in love with so many people, these days, when i&rsquo;m being honest about it. it&rsquo;s mirror month but i don&rsquo;t want to reflect because i&rsquo;m so happy in this territory.

i&rsquo;m surrounded by abuses of power every single day. i would call it exhausting, but i&rsquo;m not exhausted. i&rsquo;m hypernormalized, a neoliberal machine. i&rsquo;m a late capitalist dream, a vision in white. i&rsquo;ve learned how to be quiet and i&rsquo;m a quiet person, anyways, so was it really so hard?


i think i have an obligation to be noisy about abuses of power. but my noisiness never feels like enough (i am a quiet person). i think i&rsquo;ll keep filling my desk at work with pro-palestine trinkets. i wonder when someone will say something, suggest i tone it down. i think i&rsquo;m inviting that, probably. i want an antidote to the slow horror of occupation. i want an enemy.


i am counting my obligations. we cannot negotiate the terms of our entanglement, keely told me, once. we cannot negotiate the terms of our obligation, either. i have an obligation to my monstera that&rsquo;s too close to the winter, by which i mean too close to the window. i think i&rsquo;m too close to the winter, too. or maybe i&rsquo;m not close enough. my air conditioning unit still in, nighttime drafts cooling my face as i slumber.


it snowed today, for a few seconds. flurries drifting by my window. i want to be inside winter. i want to crawl inside its rib cage.


each year it&rsquo;s december, and i&rsquo;m checking in on how i&rsquo;ve been transformed. in what unusual ways i am unknowable to myself. i can&rsquo;t stop bringing up this concept, the unknowable. everything is unknowable, i think. nothing can be known. but then i read a critique of sengers application of complexity theory to biology and wonder if all this unknowability is serving capitalist accumulation. i, too, am being seduced by the unknowable, which is to say that i&rsquo;m being seduced by the impossibility of unendingness. resist endings, goes a header in my thesis. maybe we&rsquo;re wrong, and maybe all things should end. hospicing unknowability.


i&rsquo;m seduced by the yearly reviews that i recently stumbled upon. large documents full of prompts and tables and quotes for evaluating the status of the self. impressively long, some of them reach dozens of pages. most are free, but some are sold, because people who do months-long yearly reviews need to eat, too. everything is a grift these days, everything is a business. if i&rsquo;m the neoliberal dream i&rsquo;ve got to learn to find my own place.


i think about posting some of my art on instagram, after amalia tells me she didn&rsquo;t know i make visual art while at the post-party smoke sesh in my room at 3am. legibility is seductive, too, and i&rsquo;m being seduced because i want the money and notoriety to just live my beautiful life. step one is be legible to others. step two is get them to give you their money, which was all ripped from the earth anyways, or actually it wasn&rsquo;t, since most money is fake &mdash; drifting around in abstract spaces of credit card accounts and sovereign debt funds. no territory here, either. maybe i need to make art about territory. my simple shapes aren&rsquo;t going to cut it when the intellectual girlies get to it. besides, i need to do something with my collection of satellite images.


all language is corporate, these days. my workplace announces our garden grants for speculative biotech ideas. we label ourselves a collective. i read about the intersection of reagan era neoliberal reform and the invention of the idea of the bioeconomy. i don&rsquo;t know how to unlock this information without my corporate vernacular. which, by the way, i speak quite fluently. i am a performer at heart, and i do fantastic in the workplace, always certain that people believe in me even as i don&rsquo;t believe in myself. maybe a yearly review will force me to grapple with my own inconsistencies of personality.

but part of me is resistant to reflecting at all. some part of me still the logical optimizer. some part of me relishing in irreverent humor. some part of me alienated by all the spiritual talk of care and community. the next time i hear &ldquo;in community&rdquo; as a preposition i think i&rsquo;m going to start foaming at the mouth.


lately, i&rsquo;ve been harboring. resentments and rebelliousness. maybe the reason why i wrote this today, and finished it today (ten days later) is because i need to do something about my harboring.


i&rsquo;m just traipsing through life, honestly, which is a word that i realize i&rsquo;ve never said aloud. traipsing, traversing, trudging. all these ways to say, carrying. stuck in the trouble, the muddy thick of it. the clarity that comes with distance is increasingly difficult to find, and i&rsquo;m increasingly uninterested in seeking it out.


no, i&rsquo;m just here, in the mist and the withering winter and the territory and the seduction and the obligation and the absurdity of it all wrapped up in something i&rsquo;m supposed to call cohesive, call legible, call individual.



what has my life been, lately? it&rsquo;s been good. honestly,&nbsp;i&rsquo;m doing well.
