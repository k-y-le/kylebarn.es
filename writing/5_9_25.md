it’s the foggiest day in memory, and i’m at brooklyn bridge park. i came here because i wanted to not see the city. i wanted to catch only hints of monstrous manhattan, to indulge in the pleasure of absence. when shrouded, that which is concealed takes on alluring qualities. desire rushes in to fill the space that is left to the imagination. here’s Samantha Hunt in the seas: “The fog makes me both love and hate the weather. I hate it because it brings me down, but I love it because if the foul state continues I won’t have to do anything important with my life, and in many ways I am quite happy in that knowledge.”

my catchphrase for the week is cathedrals everywhere for those with the eyes to see. i love this meme, the way it encourages an appreciation for the sublime without taking itself too seriously. i’m seeing cathedrals this week, my eyes somehow widened to let more light in. it’s cathedrals at brooklyn bridge park, cathedrals in a 2012 solange song, cathedrals in a stack of phone screens at the repair store, cathedrals at the club, in the park, on the sidewalk, in the dandelion field.

being visited by fog in nyc feels like a gift. i’m not sure what we’re being gifted, but i know i want to receive it well. how do we receive something when we’re not sure its form, its purpose? here’s Robin Wall Kimmerer: “What else can you offer the earth, which has everything? What else can you give but something of yourself? A homemade ceremony, a ceremony that makes a home.”

there are these behaviors that i’m beginning to realize denote a period of happiness for me. in a way, they are the ceremonies that make a home. a non-exhaustive list:

- twirling as i make my way to the bathroom in my apartment
- making strange noises randomly around friends
- taking pictures of plants that i see while on a walk
- taking breaks to just look at the world around me while on a street corner (not pulling out my phone)
- looking up more often

all these, to me, denote a state of awe-receptivity. i am open to wonder, open to beauty, even in that which is mundane or disgusting. being happy and being receptive to awe are synonymous. maybe, they are ingredients for a kind of ceremony.

i have a couple friends with whom i used to send near-daily pictures of clouds, as i saw them. it started early-pandemic, i think, during that time when everyone was far more brazen in their bids for connection. sharing simple wonder at the natural world, as it turns out, makes a great vector of connection. a good tip for a first date.

i keep dreaming about absence. in one dream, i’m at olivia’s and her roommate took all their furniture, but she still offers me a seat on a cushion in the empty corner. in another, all windows are portals to empty space, the nothingness between galaxies. last wednesday, i dreamt that everyone had disappeared.

i’m trying to keep better track of my dreams. some part of me believes that they have something to offer me. by unshrouding them, i paradoxically invite in the absence they contain, while de-obscuring their nature. desire flees the imaginative space it once called home, off to greener pastures.

i listen to a podcast interview with a cloud scientist. i am trying to be a person who listens to podcasts, seduced as i am by the possibility of injecting new forms of inspiration into routine. just two days later, i’m not sure i can repeat many of the facts the scientist offered on the show. instead, i’m just left with a vague feeling, not unlike that of leaving a history museum, full of gratitude for knowledge and learning. i’m so glad i learned so much about clouds, today. the memory is a feeling. this, too, wears a shroud.

while very high on ketamine, i attempt to calculate how many hours of my life i’ve spent dancing. soy tells me the moment they see a number, their eyes glaze over. this happens to me, too, lost in the spurt of the fog machine, blending into flashing lights and swaying bodies. the shroud inside matches the shroud outside. i am lost within it.

just an hour before, cam my was telling me about how aging fundamentally comes down to attention, in that memories form out of the new — that which becomes routine can get glossed over in the construction of your memory palace. i used to believe that this was an endorsement of disruption, adrenaline-seeking behaviors and jet-set travel lifestyles. nowadays, i’m more keen on deepening my attention, which i see as a lesson in committing myself to this life, in this city. i don’t know how many hours i’ve been dancing, but i know that i have, through that time, grown in connection to my body, to music, and to community. and i know that every time (well, almost every time) i find the cathedrals of it all, the wonder and awe at immersive embodied experience.

wandering through the park with fog heavy in the air, i happen upon the opening celebration of a new public artwork, Akua by Torkwase Dyson. a crowd of art-world folks have gathered in a field with their designer clothing and asymmetrical haircuts. curious, i draw closer, and end up spending thirty minutes in the installation, listening. Akua is “a large, open pavilion with an immersive multi-channel soundscape,” in which “Dyson’s multilayered sonic composition explores the idea of ‘breath as geography.’” i’m not quite sure what that means, but i do devote particular attention to my breath as i sit in the middle of the pavilion. i like this experience, because in addition to the sometimes-ambient, sometimes-harsh soundscape of Dyson’s circling around me, there’s also the incessant chatter of folks chatting, reminiscing on their days in art school or discussing the latest show at the whitney. i feel like an eavesdropper, a surreptitious intruder, but i’m right in the middle of it all - the eye of the storm, beneath a fog of anonymity. i am the public that this art was made for, too.

a recent obsession of mine has been post-rain dandelion fields. stems weave to and fro across neglected greenery, dandelions left bereft of seeds by the recent storm, appearing simultaneously fragile and monstrous. i’ll spend a few minutes grazing over the stems with my eyes, wondering about the stories of all the seeds blown away, making their way to new places, new opportunities to sprout. i’ve taken pictures of probably ten of these fields (surely, collecting scenes of this sort should be added to the list of signs that i’m happy) in the past week.

i’m imagining collecting the stems, weaving them together into a massive blanket or dress. with this, i can truly shroud myself, become the empty space for others to fill up with their desire. i can let the fog wash over me, embrace my own disappearance. i won’t have to do anything important with my life, just keep training my eyes to see cathedrals, keep filling myself with awe, keep deepening my way into something that feels like becoming.
