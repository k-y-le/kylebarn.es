i&rsquo;ve always thought that you can portend a lot of changes around general culture by the different consumer technology rolling out in retail stores with a upper-middle class clientele. by this i particularly don&rsquo;t mean the flashy &ldquo;innovations&rdquo; in shopping that you might find in a luxury streetwear brand&rsquo;s store, for instance. i&rsquo;m thinking about the first time that i used one of those &ldquo;pick your own&rdquo; coca cola soda machines, at the pei wei in plano texas in around 2014. was this a prelude to an increasing atomization of the individual, the overwhelming nature of &ldquo;choice&rdquo; made possible by the internet and increasingly hyper-specific supply chains? maybe, or maybe i&rsquo;m stretching. but i&rsquo;ve been thinking for a while about something i noticed at the whole foods in somerville, massachusetts a couple weeks ago.


amazon one is a &ldquo;fast, FREE identity service&rdquo; that mostly hinges around a palm reading device. present your palm at an amazon store (whole foods, amazon go, etc.) and you can checkout without needing a credit card or phone. allegedly, amazon constructs your palm print by uploading images to a secure cloud server, where your identity is verified. honestly, i was a bit surprised on their website to find how little they really tried to assuage the inevitable privacy concerns. it all feels a bit dystopian, doesn&rsquo;t it? giving the mega corporation your biometric data so that they can make your life slightly more convenient? oh wait, we already do that: apple face ID, CLEAR, etc. all rely on biometrics to add convenience and security, or so it seems.

<h6 style="text-align: center;">this is the future they are selling us</h6>

amazon one is also offered to merchants, looking to add &ldquo;seamless service, faster payments, and a customized experience.&rdquo; but these kinds of touch-less payments are hardly new. amazon has been experimenting in this for a while, but other changes are emerging. the other day, when buying a bag (the ubiquitous uniqlo cross-body bag), i checked out without scanning anything. it was a simple rfid sensor that meant my checkout literally involved dropping the bag in a cubby and tapping my phone to the payment machine.


early on in the development of ubiquitous computing, scholar Mark Weiser described seamless integration as &ldquo;the nonintrusive availability of computers throughout the physical environment, virtually, if not effectively, invisible to the user.&rdquo; i&rsquo;m fascinated by the shifting ways this invisibility takes form, and for whom. the amazon one palm reader is starkly visible; it has to be, in order to be of use. but the way it operates is deliberately meant to be seamless. the more you think about how and why amazon is reading your palm, the more likely you are to be dissatisfied with your supposedly &ldquo;customized experience&rdquo; &mdash; you might even question why, in the first place, you&rsquo;re using this device. so much of technology, and the world, relies upon folks who move power not asking that why. it manifests in different ways, like investment bankers being kept extremely busy so that they don&rsquo;t ask why they&rsquo;re doing what they&rsquo;re doing &mdash; and who will be impacted. there&rsquo;s a seamlessness at work here, too.


it&rsquo;s peculiar, too, the way that amazon ends up in the business of palm reading. typically the domain of mystics and carnival psychics, palmistry has a history and origins ranging from Babylon to Persia to India to China. there&rsquo;s an interplay between seamlessness and mysticism, too. much of design education is about creating purportedly &ldquo;magical&rdquo; moments for the user, in which they are caught by a joyous surprise at how well the designed object works for them. in this context, a mystical technology is one that obfuscates its material workings in order to achieve seamlessness. but mysticism has never been neutral; this is a troubling form of magic, one that renders absent relations between technology and the land it comes from, the people who create it, and the resources that sustain it.

<h6 style="text-align: center;">every witchy girl you knew in college had some form of this poster in her dorm</h6>

it seems fitting, in the current stage of late capitalism or post capitalism or whatever you want to call it, that amazon has launched a palm reading project. as stability erodes under late capitalist precarity, people increasingly turn to the supernatural for comfort and guidance. it&rsquo;s a classic tale; society meets crisis meets God. or in this case, co-star, which has been downloaded by a quarter of all women in the US ages 18-25. co-star is a mystical technology, too, though one not quite as sinister as amazon, probably. i think it&rsquo;s no coincidence that it, as with amazon one, utilizes generative ai to flashy effect. chatbot mysticism is one of the leading causes of the current ai hype cycle that we&rsquo;re in right now. how much of it is founded vs. scam is probably too early to tell, but tracing the spiritual affect of mystical technologies now helps to identify what our technology is really doing, and for whom.


a new mystical technology that i&rsquo;ve been following along is moonlight. created by danielle baskin, formerly of dialup, one of my favorite apps in 2020, moonlight bills itself as for social rituals. on some level, it&rsquo;s purporting to be the co-star of tarot. but also i trust danielle baskin to make something with intention, that doesn&rsquo;t capitulate to vc interest. i&rsquo;m not sure co-star is quite so clean of an ad-ridden future. in particular, i&rsquo;m drawn to the focus on rituals &mdash; this is what i imagine a mystical technology to be, and what i imagine of the mystical technologies that i create. there are always going to be a multitude of ways that technology takes on the affect of mysticism, but i&rsquo;m most interested in a mystical technology that functions as a ritual facilitator, enabling new forms of coming together, of relating to one another and the ecological world, of living well.

<h6 style="text-align: center;">and why not???</h6>

in the future, i think mysticism will only increase, as the trajectory of economics and politics continues towards a loss of trust. like with hallucinating LLM systems, which only increases as they&rsquo;re fed more data that is contradictory, untrue, or self-referential (generated by an LLM itself), there&rsquo;s a danger here too. mysticism has always been dangerous, what with the witches and the radicalism and whatnot. but i think that this also means that there are ways to learn from times of transformative religious change, and apply these ideas to the way that technology is change, and is changing us.


one thing that i think sets apart those mystical technologies that feel benevolent (moonlight) vs. sinister (amazon one) is how human they are. the polished face of a consumer technology is not actually particularly appealing, to me. it&rsquo;s like landlord white paint. i&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by the ways that folks &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; places (particularly living spaces) in ways that seem to suck out all the personality of a space. going from a cozy strange apartment to a modernist sleek high-tech space can actually be a downgrade, if you ask me. it demonstrates an inability to accommodate for the unexpected. quirkiness as a bug, rather than a feature. but people do generally respond better to the personal, the handmade, the quirky. i&rsquo;m writing this in siena, italy, a town famous for its winding medieval streets and walkable historicism. nobody would say that we should raze the buildings down in order to give this city a grid pattern streets and glass high rises. so why are we doing the same type of thing to our software?


i&rsquo;ve been using this as a frame to evaluate many things in my life. how human does it feel? what are its quirks? would it scale? most people don&rsquo;t want to feel like they&rsquo;re in a manufactured situation, but that&rsquo;s what it feels like to use most anything that has been scaled to play a role in the life of millions of people. one of the violences of capitalism is how it incentivizes a growth that ignores the feeling-body. who cares what it feels like to use this service, if we can launch it in 100 cities across the country, or the world. this frame applies to other things, too. even friendships. it&rsquo;s better when it feels human, like there&rsquo;s an investment. it&rsquo;s not about what things are, really, but how they make you feel. what would an amazon look like that makes room for the unusual, that is designed to accommodate the many ways people feel about shopping and delivery and web services and palm reading and whatever other products they sell? probably, it would look radically different. not exist, maybe. be split up into a hundred different pieces. or a thousand. maybe it would be publicly owned, a co-op. i&rsquo;m not sure, but i think that seeking out (and building!) mystical technologies that occupy this space of genuine personality will help me to imagine alternatives.
