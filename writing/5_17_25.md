olivia and i just “launched” our collaboration, [chimeras collective](http://chimerascollective.cargo.site/). i put launch in scare quotes because we’ve been collaborating for a while, now, and the launch is somewhat deliberately without fanfare. instead, it feels maybe a bit more operational — we’re seeking to mold the container that will hold our practice now and into the future, for the rather practical reasons that we want to find like minded people who want to take our classes and collaborate with us in the future. but there are many ways to do so. we are trying to tread a middle path.

go to pretty much any party in brooklyn with creative people present (i am avoiding using the term “creatives” because for some reason it feels icky to me. something about the way it signals a professionalization and thus alienation of creative labor? idk), and probably at some point someone will be complaining about instagram. we all love to hate and hate to love instagram. it can feel like an obligation, a perverse pleasure, a generous pleasure, a lifeline, a client base, a portfolio, a dating profile. probably, it is all or most of these things at once. the options available for people with a creative practice to build a platform for others to consume or participate in their work are quite limited; staying off instagram is to take the harder path, usually.

but what is an instagram presence offering an artist? sometimes, it’s quite straightforward. you make rings, you want people to buy the rings. where are the people? scrolling. it’s the lowest friction way for customers to stay in the loop, become repeat customers. but i also think that a lot of art — particularly that which is more interesting to me, which is to say art that traffics in experience rather than objects — can be seduced by the rather narrow version of success that instagram offers. this is nothing new, but still something to investigate as olivia and i attempt to sustain and grow in our practice, finding the other folks exploring embodiment, play, somatics, science, spirituality, and technology in some way or form.

digital platforms, instagram in particular, seem to offer what i would call a fetish of universal consumption. i’m sure there are better ways to phrase this. but, essentially, we can easily find ourselves dreaming that everyone will want to attend our event, or visit our studio, or buy our paintings. this is silly to me, because what’s the point of creating something for everyone? usually, this dilutes the message, the practice, or the impact. it becomes like a disney show that has to have a character of every racial background, for some reason, feeding us a postracial fantasy rather than culturally specific or contextually grounded stories.

with chimeras collective, we’re interested in wild and whimsical interspecies gatherings. we want to teach classes and facilitate experiences that open our eyes to the wonder of our urban ecologies, offering us new ways of connection to the more-than-human world. many people will not be interested in this! and there are many people who i do not want to attend our events! which is to say, these kinds of things rely upon a shared sense of earnestness, which creates a safe space to experiment. it’s difficult to facilitate a safe space of this sort, and even one person who is clearly uncommitted can tank the vibe and dissolve the careful sense of safety we have built together. this is particularly relevant when facilitating outside in public space, as we like to do.

when a platform allows you to access seemingly everyone, who are you really talking to? there are so many ways to present something in a way that makes it seem alluring and desirable for the average consumer, as decades of advertising has taught us. but diluting my art in order to sell more tickets feels dangerously close to something that’s just a new kind of conformity. stand out, but not too much. make sure there are cues to the art world’s latest buzzwords. soy recently called this “A New Escalator that’s slightly queered, but actually heterosexist capitalism in its proclivity for hustle and productivity.” well put. i want to get off this ride!

creating art in nyc also contextualizes this experience, because we both live in a creative hotbed and also live in an extremely unaffordable place. when asked why i love living in nyc, i often respond that “it’s where the weirdos are.” and i mean this! i’m so, so grateful to be able to surround myself with people who see parts of me that didn’t feel seen, even in the hypercurated utopia-for-some of princeton. and to be able to make weird art that actually has an audience, to experiment with queerness and connection in ways that might feel absurd in more normative cities. this is why, for me, leaning into the fetish of universal consumption for your nyc-based art can end up just feeling like clout chasing. why do you need your events to sell out, every time? sure, it’s great for money, and can enable you to do bigger and more radical things in the future. but wouldn’t it be cool if you really challenged people? surfaced some strange alternative possibilities for connection or artmaking?

practically, i think it gets a bit more challenging to figure out the middle path through this. particularly because being anti-capitalist is, of course, quite popular these days. how do we find our way, while still ensuring that we get the exposure and support to continue making art? for olivia and i, we’re still using [instagram](https://www.notion.so/coming-soon-to-a-niche-microaudience-near-you-1f66e06b496980078f2cf495cdcb0316?pvs=21). but i think it’s a great goal of ours to get maybe 100 followers. i don’t think we need to go much bigger, just meet some of our people where they’re at, and others where they’re at (emails, meetups, spontaneous run-ins at the park while we’re all looking for bugs). we don’t want to go viral or get famous, just get enough support that we can keep hosting field trips and teaching classes without bending too much to the pressures that come with institutional support. i’m framing this as though we’re striking this perfect balance, and am wary of coming off as holier-than-thou. it’s just me working through my own trepidations regarding growing a sustainable practice! tbd how it will all work. i still hate instagram. thankfully, olivia’s a bit better at it.

i’ve been doing the artist’s way recently, which has prompted much of this thinking. what is an artist? why do i pause when telling someone that i’m an artist, couch it with conditionals? what would it mean if being an artist was easeful, validating outside of credentialism, a vector of connection to others? and perhaps most importantly, how do i stand in my truth as an artist, my quest for explorations of the edges of human experience, my cultivation of wonder, my playful spirit, without capitulating to the always-looming pressure to monetize/professionalize?

the disappointing truth is that the answer to these questions will always be in flux. there’s no ticket to get me out of the trouble of it all. that said, if anyone reading this has access to a really rich person who wants to sponsor a young artist trying to re-enchant urban ecologies… we should chat.

and if you yourself haven’t already, it would be special to have you on the [newsletter](https://www.notion.so/239-Kingston-Avenue-2-e6e5c031ca5d4399a8931e28d0048098?pvs=21), following the [instagram](https://www.notion.so/that-one-dog-on-instagram-483ef30bbc3e4f22a181bcc95d732a46?pvs=21), or participating in some future programming, like our six-session course [BECOMING CYBORG](https://www.notion.so/may-4-may-20-1e56e06b496980e885ecd3ba6449e9e3?pvs=21), our three-session seminar on [CREATURES](https://www.schoolofattention.org/enroll/p/creatures), and our upcoming FIELD TRIPS, like [this one](https://lu.ma/mumk0ch6) at the museum of natural history tomorrow. but it’s not for everyone, too! so if this isn’t you, know that there are still so many ways for us to connect and be connected <3
