as soon as it gets warm i start randomly saying it’s gonna be The Summer Of ______. this is kind of a joke. but not really!! inspired by divine the other night saying that this is going to be her summer of Yes. might just be overcaffeinated but i do think i’m going to have a deeply joyous season ahead.

it’s also the summer of multitudes. added that to the list after taking that pic. i’m embracing my multitudes! such as: this pic soy took of my desk, downloading a video game on my computer atop a glass desk full of jewelry while using an artists book about the black panther party as a mousepad, while surrounded by plants. this is real, this is me.

in the spirit of “summer of posting,” i’m going to send out more informal updates like this one. also making my way back into my writing practice after some time away from it. it's been about two months since one of these newsletters, the longest break since i started the practice a little over two years ago. i'm trying not to dwell in guilt about that, and instead honor that i've been encountering huge changes in my life, and finding new ways to relate to them and metabolize outside of writing. more on that soon. and anyways, i’ve always felt a frictional relationship with completion — much more inclined to start than to finish. as it stands, i have probably about thirty incomplete essays just waiting for the spark to complete them. but perhaps they’ll be relegated to a forever purgatory.

a theme for the current season of my life is form. starting with formlessness (of my life, of my desires, of my apartment living room), i’m meandering my way into form (formfulness?). it’s so scary (and liberating!) to realize that i can just make the form of my own life, pretty much. if only i didn’t need money. but it’s the summer of experiments, so i’m also trying to experiment with more writing. help hold me to this! and, also, please think of me if you have opportunities that are available - particularly looking for prompts or opportunities to do critical writing and personal essays, with an ecology x spirituality x technology angle.

saw this incredible tree pit on my way to the library today. someone has been gardening! i love these little moments because it’s like… who did that? i think a vibrant city is one that’s full of these little spots of care. where someone has deeply cared for making something beautiful, or functional, or community-oriented. and even if you don’t know who did it or why, you can still witness and appreciate a shared investment in the livability  of our city.
