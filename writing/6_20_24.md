a heat wave hits new york city. it sits, lingers, parked over the cemeteries and brownstones and skyscrapers alike. i feel the heat pressing down upon me, infiltrating my senses, imbuing everything with a hazy, filtered quality.

on days like these i feel a lethargy mirroring me. it’s as if my shadow, too, has to push through the languid air, and runs a few milliseconds behind my actual movements as a result. still, i am trying to love it, this too-sweet summer. i go on a long walk and feel as though i’m trudging through pooling syrup, a saccharine stickiness unavoidable everywhere i step. i’m not inclined to enjoy this weather, and look back at previous summers through that same distorted haze. what did i actually do in june of 2023? i couldn’t tell you, exactly. i was in the haze.

i get hit by a deep sadness every summer, as the temperatures rise above 90 and a sheen of sweat becomes unavoidable. as i feel the wave growing inside me again, i find myself wondering if things will be any different this year — if i can make them any different. a few ways it might be so: a membership at the community garden, an apartment with a/c, a fierce and tender love, a trip to california in the height of august. but part of me still wants to face it, to embrace the coming frustrations that signal this portion of the season, for me.

*spotted at red shed community garden... maybe they can fix me...*

there’s this pervasive feeling that things should be easier, should make more sense. if only i made some small change, if only i stuck to routines, if only it weren’t 92 degrees outside. then i would finally be able to reach a flow state, to create the things i want to create, to not feel bogged down by schedules and obligations. i call this the upgrade-trick: the politically driven personal belief that we are one upgrade away from our goals. it’s used to sell us self-help, fitness classes, food delivery, and more. always be optimizing.

but my body and mind are unknowable to myself. they operate as the entanglement of such a vast set of parameters that i could spend my whole life trying to model a single moment and never get it right. this is incredibly humbling, and incredibly compelling. it means that i can spend my entire life knowing myself, or knowing someone else, or knowing many someones, and many biospheres, and still be constantly amazed.

my two book clubs right now are for books i’m reading for the third time: annihilation by jeff vandermeer and staying with the trouble by donna haraway. returning to beloved texts at a time of clouded consciousness feels like a plea with myself, to return to some more knowable, more reliable state of being. i return to my lodestones to return to myself.

there’s a part in annihilation where the main character, upon contamination from the mysterious chimeric organisms of the region she is exploring, notices herself more acutely attuned to the ecosystem around her. the sky brighter, the wind more soothing upon the skin, the chirps of regular birds prompting endless fascination. i love the way that vandermeer describes this attunement, because it feels familiar in its depiction of the joyous overwhelm of appreciation for the world. these moments of wonder and awe when attention seems heightened, somehow.

*natalie portman was being soooo thoreau here*

what’s stopping me from becoming contaminated? i want to be always contaminated by the world. because, in many ways, i am, already comprised of the contaminated biosphere making up my microbial gut, and my many porous interfaces with the outside world. anna tsing: “We are contaminated by our encounters; they change who we are as we make way for others.”

another book i’m reading right now is ancillary justice by ann leckie, a space opera known for troubling singular perspective and gender essentialism. it is a book that operates through a surplus of information, inducing in the reader a state of just-barely-understanding that feels a bit like playing a word game or solving a puzzle. in it, i’m tuning to my most wide eyed self, the awestruck inner child attempting to make sense of an overabundant world. i love this kind of worldbuilding precisely because it doesn’t feel like escapism, because it’s like an exercise in being a more attuned self.

it’s not quite an inner child moment, which sometimes relegates experiences of awe and wonder to the domain of the adolescent. infantilization has always been a tactic for dismissing the real experiences of adulthood, thereby reifying the rote capitalist subject. nostalgia, too, can be a tool of control, and so i’m contaminating myself to try to see with fresh eyes the many wonders of the worlds. not as an antidote to my growing seasonal sadness, but as a companion. i seek intention, i seek inspiration, and i seek reprieve from the always-accelerating onslaught of it all.
