i have an article out now in long now called <a href="https://longnow.org/ideas/exactitude-in-climate-science/">on exactitude in climate science</a> (play off the borges short story). it&rsquo;s about digital twins and a move to deprofessionalize climate science that i actually believe is critically important for how we will make collective decisions in the future. a bit of a thesis statement: &ldquo;these changes to the field surface new entanglements with social and political forces that mark it as a contested discipline in which present developments will greatly influence future collective decision making.&rdquo;


i don&rsquo;t write much about my job through this newsletter, even though it&rsquo;s such a huge part of my life. under capitalism, we develop mechanisms by which we can <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/25/severance-is-sci-fi-for-the-soul">sever</a> our life on the clock and off the clock. this article was not directly a part of my job, but draws from my work on a climate science team at <a href="https://www.schmidtsciences.org/focus_area/climate/">schmidt sciences</a>, where i kinda work on data and design and justice but also don&rsquo;t do those things exactly. i&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s a merit or not that my job is notoriously difficult to describe.


something i&rsquo;m drawn to (and good at?) is understanding complex problems and making them more legible. complex problems being those which are difficult, have no clear solution, maybe under the moniker of a wicked problem. like climate science, democracy, biomanufacturing, living well. i think i have some skill at analyzing and producing simpler and more equitable modes of engagement to expand the possibility space of influence on an impactful-yet-unintuitive part of how we come together. this is why i&rsquo;ve worked in climate science. why i write about it.


claiming authority over how an idea can or should operate often requires credentials and prestige, of which i have neither, when it comes to climate science. and yet i feel an imperative to prompt more complex thinking about climate data, and about climate science as a discipline of increasing importance as we navigate our place on a changing planet. in the article: &ldquo;This move to deprofessionalize climate science, whether through a digital twin or otherwise, is a welcome one, as it signals an understanding that positioning ourselves as planetary inhabitants is an essential part of making responsible decisions on collective scales, from the local to the regional to the global.&rdquo;


there are these unsexy things that matter a lot. infrastructure, collectivity, justice &mdash; often come unpackaged, unbranded, unexpected. part of <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/staying-with-the-trouble">staying with the trouble</a> is facing those head on. living in the world and with the world, even as it asks you to deeply engage with different fields or disciplines. this is particularly true as someone with the privilege to do so. by consciously resisting (though not entirely! i am always captured by Image and Aesthetic) the roles, fields, and ideas that value glamor occasionally at the expense of substance, i&rsquo;m seeking to find the troublesome spaces where my work can expand the field of possibility. looking for peripheries, we may find ourselves closer to centers of power than we expect. in theory, anyways.


one of the concepts that i raise but don&rsquo;t spend an excess of time on in the long now piece is &ldquo;infrastructure of collectivity.&rdquo; i see climate science as an emergent infrastructure of collectivity, in that it is becoming a core aspect of how we make collective decisions about what to build, what regulations to make, etc. i&rsquo;m interested to expand on this idea in future writing and art making &mdash; how does information move from science to infrastructure? how do we ensure equitable access to the data that undergirds climate forecasting? how does it change democracy to dynamically understand one&rsquo;s place in a planetary climate system? infrastructure is one of those unsexy things, but it&rsquo;s also endlessly fascinating. and while it&rsquo;s obnoxiously academic to tie some neologisms together and call it infrastructure, thinking through the ways in which information becomes essential surfaces urgent problems necessary to address in the field of climate science. i also don&rsquo;t want to just stop at surfacing the problem; i&rsquo;m dissatisfied by the complacency by which writing and art making around the unsexy infrastructural problem pose questions without meaningful engagement with the answers. doing climate science at work is one way i approach things more practically, although i&rsquo;m still constantly questioning the actual influence of such a method.


still, i&rsquo;m in my 20s and bearing all the identity markers of someone whose proclamation of expertise is likely to signify more self interest and class preservation than actual change: white, male, ivy league educated, working at a job that&rsquo;s essentially think tanky, has a newsletter. attempting to convey some sort of authority on a discipline as simultaneously urgent and expansive as climate science poses intriguing questions, many of which point towards me not claiming this authority whatsoever. i try to imbue some humility into my writing, making clear that the craft is as much a way by which i make sense of my place in the world as it is a potential influence to others. what do i have to offer? what matters about the problems i choose to engage in? and who am i to speak on them? it&rsquo;s healthy to always consider these questions, no matter your purported authority on a subject. at the same time, i lay claim to the idea that my writing has something to offer, whether it be ideas (climate science becoming an infrastructure of collectivity) or perspective (why digital twins might matter for an average person) or even just tone/style. besides, if you don&rsquo;t like it, you don&rsquo;t have to read it.


one of the joys of life is witnessing your interests emerge. holding loosely to the future and letting it express itself leaves space for serendipity to bloom. one of those ways that my interests have emerged has been in an intellectual, political, and infrastructural engagement with the ways we come together to make decisions. as i examine my future beyond my current fellowship and beyond current structures of capitalism i am enmeshed in, i see a path forward where i continue to develop the skill of thinking in this mode. which is to say, my writing on climate science is one part of how i find influence without claiming authority.


one of my words for the current season is simulation, inspired by wendi&rsquo;s observation that i am constantly engaging with simulations in my work. i&rsquo;m convinced that simulations play an essential role in the future, and that we need ways to think with them beyond the obligatory &ldquo;we live in a simulation&rdquo; meme and baudrillard-esque philosophizing on media. uncovering complexities of the world, we turn to simulations to help us apprehend the scope of the problems we encounter. i see this in climate science, just as much as i see it in my current work on biomanufacturing and in my previous work on democracy reform.


anyways, check out the article, if you&rsquo;d like. i would be happy to engage with any thoughts you may have. and i intend to continue writing along a similar vein, so i&rsquo;ll always appreciate resources and ideas on simulations and their entanglement with our world, particularly with regards to climate and other planetary systems.
