the color of today is blue. prussian blue. i’m spending some time with it, its richness meandering into the crevasses of my mind. ([i make a playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5yb0xMs8xY5sNTAJCYgOnk?si=dce967c06a334504)) one thing i love about cyanotypes is that they’re negatives — the fills up the inbetween. to make a satisfactory cyanotype, you have to play with negatives. layers, too. i’ve been layering my cyanotypes, drawing in an intuitive style atop their varying blue depths. 

it’s one of those days where you can hardly taste the air. usually, there’s some flavor to it — a summer’s heavy condensation or a winter’s sharp and slightly spicy edge. but today i taste nothing, and so relish the space i’m left with, filled as it is with acidic undertones of fresh espresso and orange zested cinnamon roll. 

what luxury is this! i am in the background of someone’s zoom call. i am overhearing another’s. today, i’ve been making eye contact. it’s something to do with the tasteless air, that makes me feel lighter, makes me feel like a challenge. a flirty interaction with the bakery attendant and i forget for a second my anxieties; will anyone take my class, will the electric bill be so high again, is my friend ignoring me or just going through their own stuff. i queue the new blood orange album, and take refuge. i like the way that it seems to lack specificity. it evokes a mood, but one that could be anywhere, with anyone. i package it up and take a tentative bite.

i recognize the barista as someone i nearly lived with, a couple of years ago. she was a stranger, but after having poor luck with someone i knew, i was willing to take a chance on a stranger. for reasons i can’t quite recall, it didn’t come together, but she seems well, if a bit overworked. it’s sweet to see a near-stranger after a while, get a glimpse into their new life. since deleting social media, these moments have taken on a more romantic sheen. they say absence makes the heart grow fonder, and lately i’ve been cultivating absence.

there’s a list somewhere in my brain of absence: college friends whose paths diverged, lovers with hearts broken and (hopefully) repaired, choices considered but not made. these days it feels as though very few decisions are made for me; each day unspools and forms new patterns. i used to obsess over the sylvia plath poem with the fig trees, over how much i wanted to split my life and explore the alternate universes where i didn’t go to that school, didn’t take that job, didn’t play that sport. but now i’m mostly enjoying the shape of the figs as they ripen, how their color deepens and their flesh grows taut. it’s like watching a cyanotype develop, the green solution darkening in sunlight before, in a flash that i can only describe as magic, washing into that wonderous prussian blue.

*good colors at the botanic garden today... as usual*

i think part of what is intoxicating about new york is the sheer breadth of choices made available here. i can get drunk on agency. it’s a feeling which, like drinking too much, surges over you and through you as a wave. i’ve been wondering if i can cultivate in my life a more dreamlike manner of passing through it, rather than the calculatedness that comes more easily. if astrology is to be believed, it is in my nature as a virgo to be exacting, precise. but in this virgo season, as i near the end of my twenty-sixth year of life, i feel more called to the air than the earth. 

i’ve been watching birds. not bird watching, in the more traditional way of the hobby, but devoting some special attention to them whenever we cross paths. i love the way sparrows hope along sidewalk, and manage to land in the most perfectly sized gaps in the fence i pass on my morning walk to yoga. i love the various plumage on the round heads of pigeons as they rush to move out of the way of an oncoming car. and most of all, i love the way large birds — raptors, mostly — catch currents of air, soaring high without exerting much energy. i have almost always felt a kinship with these birds, but lately the yearning to soar like them has felt palpable. i need to feel that wind in my face, see the earth from above. 

i’ve been reading a samantha hunt [book](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/53ab8f63-9acc-4560-b20f-274f6b0f7b8a) about nikola tesla, amongst other things. he was, famously, in love with a pigeon towards the later years of his life. this particular pigeon he considered to be his wife, though she was hardly tethered to domesticity the way most wives were in that time. there’s a kinship i feel with tesla, too, seeing as he similarly went through life as a tall gangly eccentric always looking to the next project, and a surprising obsession with pigeons. hunt’s fictionalized version of tesla falls in love with a pigeon because he deems humans too cumbersome, sees a bird as a being just flightly enough to match him.

i like to think that the pigeons have a much more precise sense of taste, and would agree with today as tasteless. but the truth is that i have no idea what their sense of taste is like, if they even care about the subtle flavors of city air. they likely don’t take pleasure in flying the way i imagine it, because that’s just what they do. perhaps they mirror my envy, but for running, or dancing, or all the other things humans do with human bodies. the leading scientific theory for how birds have such fine-tuned navigation capabilities is magnetoreception: they sense the earth’s magnetic field via signals interpreted from iron in their beaks or eyes. it’s a compelling theory, and one that signals just how different the sensory landscape of a bird is from a human. i’ll add this to the list of absences: the distance between me and the birds i yearn after while i lay in the grass and stare up at the sky.
