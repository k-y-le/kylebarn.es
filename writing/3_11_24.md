spring is here!! it’s fifty degrees outside and so windy and i am caffeinated. i’m so happy that i decided to finally start drinking coffee sometimes because it is literally a drug. and i literally love drugs. like this one, at least. sitting in the corner of the swedish cafe with sun on my face and a baby and an english bulldog both making eyes at me, i keep repeating this old blood orange song. *i am not your savior… i am not your savior babygirl.* i’ve been really loving pained earnest songs lately. what does that say about me… am i pained? am i earnest? i make a playlist called *[praise and remember](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5PKziWC7FlbE0PomWCH3pT?si=8e93baeb282b42ed).* i’m praising. i’m remembering.

remember this? i tell my roommates that i wish my name were svetlana. i talk about clowning with someone i went on a blind date with in november and just met again for the first time. i compare a sweet chili dorito to the water of life in dune. i keep doing heel clicks, for some reason. maybe that’s me being earnest. and a little bit pained.

i mix ben and my kimchi (mostly credit to ben) with a 2 pound package of seaweed salad from costco. i follow it with a 3 pound bag of dried mango from costco. clearly, i was recently at costco. actually, i went on meher’s birthday, right after a trip to the noguchi museum (next door). following the serene japanese sculpture garden with the chaotic surplus of costco felt like an obvious metaphor. like if i were reading a short story where that happened i would be like ughhhh why are they being so obvioussss. but that’s how life is! it’s obvious! it’s absurd! amitav ghosh writes that our climate storytelling is lacking because often climate disaster is so absurd that we find it unrealistic. the apocalypse is sooo cliche. lately, i’ve been looking at concrete, instead.

concrete feels like apocalypse to me, when i think about it ecologically. imagine yourself a tree, sending roots to nourish your growing body, and you’re confronted with this massive immovable substance. do the trees on the side of the road feel boxed in, claustrophobic? i’m claustrophobic thinking about it. i love to move, so i guess i could never be a tree. at the ice rink this morning someone tells me that i move like a bird. they’re calling me elegant, and i’m wondering if it has anything to do with my loose t shirt or abstract tattoos.

one of the songs on the playlist is called *cigarette packet. i can feel it all end by the end of the cigarette packet.* there’s a nervous energy to the song, like the cigarette is the only thing keeping her together. maybe it really will all end by the end of the cigarette packet.

she’s talking about love, i’m talking about society, or something like that. i love songs like this that feel like they’re romanticizing chance encounters and scene-y environments. i love it because the actual encounters are pretty much never like this. *started with a bang ended with a kiss.* like… maybe? probably started with an instagram dm and ended with everyone standing around being too cool to talk to each other. sometimes the coolest thing you can do is not care what others think. i feel coolest when i’m dancing at the club, wearing my loose outfits looking like a bird or a ghost or maybe like my name is svetlana.

on saturday, i made my dj debut at my roommates’ birthday party. my dj name is *bad egg,* because i love that name. but maybe i should change it to svetlana. maybe floods are cliche, but so is me learning to dj after moving to brooklyn. serving up some scrambled tunes. i love learning new skills, i love offering those skills as gifts to my friends. book me for your next party!! just kidding haha unless etc etc

now i’m walking home and i come across some batteries in the dirt by a tree on the side of the road. imagine planting a battery. what would grow? something toxic, something energized, something apocalypse, something mundane.

while walking home i send a voice memo to a few friends i haven’t spoken to in a while. i’m so full of springtime energy, like i’m going to sprout. it’s also a bit feral, this feeling inside me, like the sprout is actually zombie cordyceps fungi and i’m going to end up climbing to the highest point around me and letting it burst through my skull.

actually, i have been considering joining the climbing gym a block away from my next apartment, and i have been thinking a lot about avalokitesvara, the bodhisattva of great compassion. i have been told that one story for the depiction of avalokitesvara (eleven faces) is that he had so much compassion for mankind that his skull burst open and ten new faces emerged. this image is fascinating to me. i add “skull burst open from compassion like avalokitesvara” to my list of ways i would like to die. 

other lists in my life: current projects (too many), features for a website project (too many), people to invite to the next moon party (too many), songs to download for bad egg’s next dj set (too many), promising biomanufacturing pathways (too few). now there’s this list of lists, and i didn’t even include many of the most recent. but i can’t stop saying yes to the constantly growing pile of projects i’m part of. but that’s life! my life is a project. the project of living well. the project of socialism. the project of queerness. when academics use “project” to mean the constructed behavior of an idea/ideology, it reminds me that i can intellectualize my life as a project, too. and it’s going well, we’re entering Q2 with our objectives ambitious yet achievable. changing status to : simply vibing.
