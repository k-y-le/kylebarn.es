i have forgotten how good honey tastes

i am asking the ceramicist at the craft fair if she thinks i should quit my job

i am waking up at 5am to go out with the late night crowd

i feel bad about loving new york city because it’s so inaccessible and overwhelming even though it’s the perfect amount of whelming for me, but that makes me feel bad too because i’m used to being told that i do too much and i should be slowing down

i go to the library and get two books with birds on the covers

i get hit by a sense of dread as i get on my bike because i feel like it would take a couple days for anyone to notice that i died

i spend an hour on the line with verizon trying to find out whose number is attached to our wifi account

i reject the job someone asked me to apply for because i think that being “at the intersection of data science, engineering, and business impact” would make me want to die

i wake up and water my plants and immediately feel as though a weight has been lifted from my shoulders

i agree to go out to lunch for my coworker’s birthday even though the main reason i came into work was to save money on lunch

i realize that i never texted my friend back about her party fundraiser for a lesbian romantic comedy and instead just never showed up (i was sleeping so that i could wake up at 5am to go out)

i have spent at least 5 total hours researching phones that i could get as mine continues to deteriorate. i feel no closer to making an actual decision

i tell the artist i look up to that i’m thinking of quitting my job and when she asks me “to do what?” i fumble the answer and feel bad about it the whole way home

i panic when i really think about how most of the things i truly enjoy doing will bring in minimal amounts of money and maybe i’m doomed to a life of contorting myself
