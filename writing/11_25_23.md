it&rsquo;s the season of Wanting. in america, at least, which at this point means basically in the world, since even halloween feels like a global phenomenon - if it can sell more cheap goods. this year, i&rsquo;m thankful that i&rsquo;m not someone who feels an attachment to &ldquo;the economy&rdquo; and is scared by the idea that people generally might be buying less. what do i want? i want a weeklong pause on Buying Unnecessary Things. i think it could really change the world.


i have a slightly complicated relationship to the Wanting Season because i&rsquo;m someone who wants a lot in life, most of which will never be achieved. no matter how hard i try, i&rsquo;m never going to look like a piece of rose quartz, even if i keep dreaming about it. my want will not result in a spiral staircase to the clouds that appears on my roof. but if a genie granted me three wishes today, that would probably be one of them.


i enjoy naming my wants, particularly those that are absurd or impossible, because it reminds me that my desires are a strange and ever-changing part of myself. and i think it serves to counterbalance the unending manipulation of desire by capitalism. in a society where the primary function of an individual is to consume, is it radical to express un-commodifiable desires? perhaps, but perhaps not. i&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some way for me to monetize my dream of fusing my body with a meadow, i just haven&rsquo;t figured it out yet. maybe that&rsquo;s what the metaverse is for.


i&rsquo;m writing on black friday, the ultimate celebration of Wanting in america. never is it more celebrated to desire something. salivating over the numbers game of black friday sales while supply chains continue to extract labor power and natural resources into the pockets of a select few has never been so chic. what does black friday look like for me? i had sex, went to a protest for palestine, sat on a $10k couch in the restoration hardware store, laughed at the $30 friendship bracelet store in the west village, ate at a vegan brazilian restaurant, took a bath (with a lush bath bomb - cruelty free! i&rsquo;m such a good consumer). o holiday of Wanting, did i get what i wanted out of you? i suppose so; i spent time with beloveds and took care of myself and sat on a nice couch. all coated with a generous dose of superiority for being a brave anticapitalist in the belly of the beast.

<h6 style="text-align: center;">i&#39;m so confused how a store full of terrible $30 friendship bracelets can afford west village retail rent</h6>
&nbsp;

as a highly educated white american, i&rsquo;m well practiced in metabolizing my own guilt. there&rsquo;s no better time than the holidays to do so. i&rsquo;m entering into consumer ketosis, as i reach a record pace of acknowledging, internalizing, and finally rejecting my own commodity fetishes. dukkha is a never ending ssense sale.


and still i keep Wanting. yesterday, during a psilocybin-induced period of intense reflection on my own methods of expression, i realized that i frequently present my opinions as a matter of wants and not-wants. i want a release from creativity discourses. i don&rsquo;t want climate tech venture capitalists to dominate mitigation efforts. in that moment, i decided that i would experiment with a writing practice that removes myself from the equation entirely, in an attempt to locate the core truths of my own thoughts on the world. so, naturally, i&rsquo;m now writing this essay which is wholly and entirely about me, myself, and the things i Want in the world.


i&rsquo;m exploring what i want in the world because i&rsquo;m tired of it constantly being weaponized against me and my communities. under capitalism, i&rsquo;m supposed to want an unfathomable amount of things, from a perfect body to a big house to the oppression of people who don&rsquo;t look like me. so critical have i become of the neoliberal impulse to Want that i have self-assigned guilt to most forms of desire. i feel guilty for the commodities that i do genuinely desire (not forced upon me by some societal pressure), because i struggle to look past the entanglement of all commodities with extraction and oppression. it would be silly to expect an uncomplicated relationship with desire while living in a world where desire is the very means of dominant forms of social control. but in this heightened time of Wanting, perhaps listing out my wants will illuminate if not disentangle some of these tricky feelings. i want a guilt-free desire. i know i can&rsquo;t get it, so the least i can do is name the guilt and move on.

<h6 style="text-align: center;">i want to live inside this three dimensional projection&nbsp;of a principal component analysis of citrus hybrids. like sooooooo bad</h6>
&nbsp;

they say if you love something, set it free, so i&rsquo;m setting the following Wants free into the world so that they may take on a life of their own. maybe they&rsquo;ll come back to me (true love&hellip;), or maybe they&rsquo;ll be lost to me forever. i wish them well on their journey.


**


i want a tiny table, where i can put my tiny precious objects.


i want to make a big pot of soup for all my friends. we each bring a bowl that is special to us and admire them and each other as we nourish our bodies. there are candles and flowers and the most beautiful thing at the table is our love for one another.


i want liberation for all peoples. this includes non-humans.


i want a beautiful ceramic honey pot with one of those wooden honey dippers. i want to watch the honey glisten as it falls in the morning light coming through my kitchen window.


i want a deep soak.


i want recommendations for beautiful things to read and look at, like <a href="https://www.fantagraphics.com/products/eight-lane-runaways">this incredible graphic novel</a> maya shared with me recently. i&rsquo;m serious. please send me your beautiful things to read and look at.


i want fruit on the cusp of ripeness. the feeling of anticipation knowing that soon its juices will sate my appetite. (in this case, i want the wanting. the satiation-to-come is desirable in and of itself)


i want weeds growing in the cracks of concrete.


i want a shoe horn, so that i don&rsquo;t keep scraping my knuckles when i put my shoes on.


i want tools for creation: a cake pan, petri dishes, seeds.


i want to fill my life with gatherings full of intention. i want dinner parties and listening parties and intellectual seminar parties and dance parties and art parties and artsy parties and cringe parties and wild parties and tender parties.


i want my toes in the grass, toes in the sand, toes in a plush carpet.


i want to quench. my thirst, and others&rsquo;.


i want books that make me think. some recent loves: <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393357622">wayward lives, beautiful experiments</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Disappearance+of+Rituals%3A+A+Topology+of+the+Present-p-9781509542758">the disappearance of rituals</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/a-geology-of-media">a geology of media</a>.


i want a sustained passion for understanding how the world works, and how to make it work better.


i want to write freely and expressively.


i want emotional stability when i find myself alone or in unstructured time. i want the will to refuse my own addictions to the psychological-trick of infinite scrolling.


i want a more critical relationship with convenience. i want to stop overeating processed snacks from trader joes just because they&rsquo;re easy.


i want a life full of intention.


i want some fuzzy slippers.


i want to keep writing the things that i want, but i&rsquo;m afraid i would go on forever. i don&rsquo;t want to get lost in my own desires, and in doing so become blinded to the experiences of others.


i want to live and to love for my entire life.
