lately i’ve rather obnoxiously been giving every period of my life a label. i think its felt particularly fun because i’m in this amorphous phase of living, in which outside markers of time can feel slippery. some things stick, like an election (yay zohran!), but others feel unimportant, like B-tier holidays. in recognition of the always-constructed nature of all the systems we rely upon, i find myself engaging my own constructions. 

this past week was my Week of Exhaustion. kicked off my a 4pm to 4am evening of dancing friday, i found myself outside often, despite the heat wave — playing volleyball, celebrating the summer solstice, dancing even more. at peak heat i make my way to brighton beach, where crowds of teenagers yell about things i can only begin to decipher. extreme heat means the body works harder to maintain your internal temperature; sunshine doubles down in a war against your staying hydrated. after biking in and out of manhattan for a soccer game last night, i found it incredibly difficult to get out of bed this morning, even after sleeping in until 9am.

*learning how to nap*

the previous weekend, though, was different: my Sensory Weekend. on saturday i found myself embodying a flatworm, using just touch to feel my way around, as part of a workshop. then sunday morning i was dancing with the trees, taking in the scents of forest while foraging in the bronx, munching on mugwort leaves. as idyllic as it sounds, i had to balance it out with one of my favorite things: processed sugar, this time in the form of trader joe’s strawberry doodle cookies. which, by the way, are delightfully delicious. after guiding a meditation on pigeon navigation techniques, i ended up in a greenpoint loft, high out of my mind and drifting in and out of sleep while eden and friends played a beautiful set.

adding thematic markers of time is one of the ways i make meaning out of a meaningless world. it can be liberating, i think, to realize that you’re free to assign importance to anything you want. choose a favorite tree and start to honor it with offerings. decide that for one day you’re going to make eye contact with every dog you see. wear a bald cap to the club. nobody is going to stop you!!

in reflecting on these periods of my life, i’ve also started to write down casual observations and notes to remember. i, like most of us, have a remarkable propensity to forget why i did a particular thing, and writing has for years now been a mechanism by which i track my own evolution in response to unending stimuli. i’d like to share some of these now, because in writing them out they crystallize into a more visible form, and because they offer a glimpse into where my mind is at, these days

- **bars can be fun when they’re full of hot people:** i usually don’t like going to a bar, because i’m not really a drinker, and i find it annoying to try to have a conversation in loud places. i’d rather just dance! but olivia and i had a sweet time at a bar last friday just enjoying being surrounded by hot people. and doing personality quizzes.
- **the head is an underappreciated source of sensory input:** as part of [how to become an octopus](https://www.recessart.org/events/338-how-to-become-an-octopus-and-sometime-squid-saturday-afternoon-options), i started to explore my surroundings while embodying a flatworm via the back of my head. turns out you can sense a lot of the world with your head… and it feels good
- **more talks with cozy corners:** the longevity of my ability to sit through a talk is greatly multiplied when i can be laying down/stretching/moving around a bit
- **trees make excellent dance partners**: especially the teenagers (younger, still tall and dependable, but pretty flexible to sway back and forth)
- **permission to sleep changes everything:** yes, i dozed during my friends’ show on sunday… yes, they gave me permission! not that i needed it, but setting and intention go a long way in altering how you interact with music and other art forms. some things are relaxing — sometimes, you don’t need to be the Correct Audience Member.
- **why do we need fancy donuts?** i woke up on saturday with an intense craving for a simple glazed donut, but somehow that’s the only thing that’s difficult to get around my apartment
- **sometimes i forget that there are famous people:** at the warehouse rave on saturday we came across eric andre doing whippits. turns out, new york is full of people famous for various reasons. i knew this, but i keep forgetting - and probably pass by plenty of microcelebs all the time, without noticing.
- **pushing your body just to see what happens:** i enjoy a reminder of the amount which i can push my body - to keep dancing, to stay awake, to continue playing a game. but also, i don’t find it addicting and personally get freaked out by adrenaline seekers and super-fitness-people
- **need to decide on a favorite map projection**: on saturday at the rave, arunima whips out the question: do yall have a favorite map projection? first off, great question. secondly, shoot, do i prefer goode-homolosine or waterman butterfly? (goode-homolosine, for now…)

*for your reference*

- **sometimes you can tell someone’s screen time just by how they talk**: and dress, too. trends move so quickly these days that i feel like one of the only reliable ways to differentiate style can be online vs. offline
- **make a silly little video with your friends:** yesterday olivia devlin and i spent hours in prospect park making a psychological thriller short film about an orange monkey named Papaya. it was exhausting (so hot) but also incredible. make a video for no reason other than that you want to, and you will find yourself laughing so much.
- **salty georgian cheese bread. forever.**
