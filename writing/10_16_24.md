on the instagram alley in dumbo. overlooking the trains as they cross the manhattan bridge, i’m watching a 16mm film of people holding and peeling imaginary fruits, reflected in the window. i’m eating mango and dragon fruit and papaya and tamarind and another fruit whose name i already forgot but i know that i’ve had before. something playful here. cloying fragrances emanating off the table in waves. kaixi and ben start passing the largest avocado i’ve ever seen back and forth, and suddenly we’re dancing with our fruits.

i’m reminded of olivia, telling me about how you can let the object guide you. how do we rethink our relationship to the fruit? i am not the only one with agency, forcing it around. instead it guides me. i go where the fruit wants to go. giving up control, giving up agency. understanding the spirit in other things will always be in some way speculative; we are all in our heads. claudia speaks of [her work](http://www.claremi.net/) as examining fruit as a form of intangible memory, memories which point to systemic forgetting, forceful dispossession. i can’t believe how big that avocado is.

community is the buzzword, but i’m not sure what’s better. i’m feeling grateful to be a part of many communities here. some that i have gathered, some that are emergent, some bubbling up around new institutions, new attempts to widen the space of possibility to be together. widen is the word. what am i widening? am i wide? spacious? at creature class kayra talks about expansion and contraction, feeling like she is the size of the meadow, until approaching the walnut tree stump brings her back to human-scale. people are doing things. i’m doing things. widening.

i’m wearing the hat that isa made me, and gave to me at eden’s party. on the ends are charms gifted to me from alice and sabrina. charms they made at amalia’s ritual in the show that abbi curated. the show i was at because aishah and mayron interviewed me. tracing friendship, i like to call it, a more tender form of the “who do you know here.” anna tsing: “if we want to know what makes places livable we should be studying polyphonic assemblages, gatherings of ways of being.” we make it fanciful (*polyphonic assemblages*) but it need not be so — kaixi hands me a pomegranate, and we dance.
