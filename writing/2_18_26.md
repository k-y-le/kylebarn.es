in *drive your plow over the bones of the dead,* olga tokarczuk writes that “winter mornings are like steel; they have metallic taste and sharp edges.” it makes me think about this sculpture by gunther uecker, *sting house* (1967). it’s been a brutal winter. frigid. days unspool into weeks below freezing, snow turning to slush turning to ice. each morning, tendrils of frozen air meander their way into my room through the window, like the spikes of *sting house.* i wake cocooned in covers, muster up the courage to toss my sheets aside, embrace the cool air, watch the sunrise as i start my day. winter is about learning to love the sting.

*surrealists love to stick a pin in everything*

i feel as though my hands keep icing over. it’s something about poor circulation, the difficulty the heart has in pumping blood through to the phalanges of such a long body. i cry most times i go outside. it’s the cold wind, mostly, but sometimes emotional, too. collin tells me that emotional tears contain cortisol, are different from laughter tears, which are different from weather tears. meteorologists are saying it might be another two weeks before we hit a thaw. i wonder if tear ducts can get worn out. should i be doing eye exercises, should i start using eye drops?

for imbolc and the snow moon, we lit candles to help us welcome in the spring, asking ourselves where we might have hardened to make it through winter. i keep talking about how cold it is, but that’s because it’s all there is. white hills still greet me when i travel outside, still reflect sunlight into my eyes when i sit at my desk in the afternoon. how have i been hardened? how have i been stung? i prod my soft spots, feel for the wounds.

*this is what it feels like*

i have long had this desire to live somewhere harsh and unforgiving. there’s a romance to it, survival as resistance. mischa and i have talked about dreams of going north for the winter, finding darkness and biting wind and empty lifeless spaces. something i loved about blade runner 2049 was its atmospheric depiction of such harsh spaces, not untouched wilderness but salvage zones. infrastructure laid bare, the quiet of detritus. i haven’t been to the wide open in a while. i think texas beckons me.

*take me there… but without the dystopia, perhaps*

the sting opens space, makes room. i feel the icy wind on my cheeks and notice a withering away within me. something is melting, despite the frigidity, something is loosening its grip against the winter chill. the soft animal of my body punctured by what it loves, stricken, striated.

so it is with grief, too. winter is a time for grieving, or at least has been for me for many years now. here’s simone weil: “to love purely is to consent to distance, it is to adore the distance between ourselves and that which we love.” the task of a cold snap, of a bitter season, is to learn to love the distance. there’s distance between us, a distance that widens and contracts depending on circumstance. and then there’s the distance within us, shaped by the sting.

*it makes me feel like this*

i have been craving spring in a newfound way. it is a feral feeling, a desperate desire to claw my way out of winter’s grip. i have always loved this season for its brutality, for its scraping away of my layers to reveal the tender core underneath. but this time around the scraping is a touch too acute. it’s not that i’m any sadder this year, just that the sadness has more space to fill. i’ve been joking that on the first day it reaches over 50 degrees in nyc, i’ll be spending all day outside, picnicking, luxuriating in the promise of spring. still, we’re far off. in the meantime, i’ll be climbing atop the sting house of my life, yelling from the rooftop, tending to my distances.
