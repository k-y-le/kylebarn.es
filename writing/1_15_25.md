for the first full moon of the year, the wolf moon, we howled from the living room of my apartment. we made an altar of our intentions for the year, and danced in the moonlight. some folks also mentioned dreams: screening a film, a harp performance, a community digital cleanse. thus sparked the idea of hosting a moon bulletin — an ongoing compilation of gatherings, performances, and other events that my friends are doing.

[you can subscribe here](https://buttondown.com/moon-bulletin). i’m currently planning on sending out dispatches every first and third quarter moon, with events for the coming days of the moon cycle. i want it to feel like “here are all the cool things my friends are doing / going to!” and invite more cross-pollination. i also want it to be collaborative — if you have an event you’d like to share, particularly one you’re hosting or facilitating, please let me know. i’m looking for nyc events (or virtual) that range from the spiritual to the ecological to the musical and between — what’s more important is the spirit of friendship (ok that’s cheesy af but you know what i mean) than the actual topic it focuses on.

i’m wary of starting another newsletter. wary of getting the wires crossed, wary of struggling to keep up, wary of biting off more than i can chew, wary of being overeager. but i started this newsletter more than two years ago (!) because i wanted to experiment with an alternative form of social media. now i’m almost entirely off all social media, and am still missing one core part of the equation. instagram is really really useful for finding and advertising events. it actually helps so much to have an instagram presence. but i don’t want to use the platform, and so i hope that this newsletter can plug up some of the hole left by not finding events via instagram. maybe that’s what it can be for you — a place you look to before you scroll, with a trusted light curation.

i also have found myself tiring of the routine of texting my ~30ish people in the city on repeat for every event i host. as i anticipate doing more hosting/facilitation in the future this year, i want a way to more ambiently connect. i think some of the best tools are made into a reality by someone who wanted something for themselves and decided to make it + share with others. not that this is a particularly novel idea, but i hope that the moon bulletin will be a resource for myself and for others. plus i just like the idea of having more friends come to events that i’m at, cultivating more of the feeling of a scene without the drama of in-group dynamics.

where will this experiment take me? maybe i’ll find it too much additional workload and abandon the project. maybe it will grow (i don’t want it to go viral, but i am interested in bringing more acquaintances / sympathetic strangers in — please do feel free to forward to friends who would be interested) and become a larger initiative. maybe i’ll start hosting group new moon rituals, as a counterpart to the full moon gatherings i already facilitate. maybe i’ll start living my entire life by the moon calendar, and abandon the tyranny of the clock. i do have the intention of making a cute poetic website to display events, alongside the newsletter, but i’m going to keep it simple for now; i tend towards overambition.

i have considered the moon a companion for many years now, and am eager to deepen the relationship. the invitation she’s offered me has been to tell time by natural cycles, to relish in celebratory community, to grieve and play together. i find myself a more thoughtful and spiritually connected person because of it. in some small way, this project aims to share in the invitation, inviting us to embrace the power and possibility of organizing ourselves outside of social media. again, if you’re interested, the [link is here](https://buttondown.com/moon-bulletin) to subscribe <3
