i deliberately chose to use tinyletter for my newsletter instead of something like substack because the associations with self-branding are too strong (&quot;subscribe to my substack!&quot;). that said, tinyletter is actually... not a very good product. so sometimes the images don&#39;t come through! sorry about the spam, but hopefully this one works :p

i keep finding myself in the cemetery. let me rephrase: i keep ending up in the cemetery. but also, i&rsquo;m kind of finding myself, because i find the cemetery to be one of the best places to ponder. everyone needs a spot(s) to ponder, i think. pondering as a human right. jenny odell: &ldquo;to capitalist logic, which thrives on myopia and dissatisfaction, there may indeed be something dangerous about something as pedestrian as doing nothing: escaping laterally toward each other, we might just find that everything we wanted is already here.&rdquo;

i find myself drawn to the cemetery, greenwood cemetery in brooklyn in particular, because it serves as a confluence of so many aspects of being alive. the whole city is a constant palimpsest being rewritten, and so the cemetery speaks volumes to the ways that we as humans try to resist the tides of change and freeze something in place. in this case, death. at the same time, the cemetery is alive, buzzing and blooming. it always has been and always will be a contested space in which political, social, environmental, religious, and state values collide.

in&nbsp;greenwood&nbsp;cemetery, which has banned biking and jogging (why? something about the sacredness of death, i guess?), the only ways to get around are to walk or drive.&nbsp;there&rsquo;s&nbsp;something peculiar about cars driving around a cemetery. it feels as though they disturb the peace. in a way, the car mimics the grave, as a space of seclusion (bersani reference kinda unintentional). being in a car seals you off from the outside world, creates a shroud of private property largely impenetrable. except when it isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;car&nbsp;accidents are a leading cause of death for non-elderly americans. being cordoned off from the world makes one vulnerable to little mistakes, such as falling asleep at the wheel, that have devastating consequences. how ironic, then, that the primary way to get around greenwood is in the machine most likely to put you there.


it&rsquo;s very american. like we need this distance from death, but we also need to keep it close. we can&rsquo;t look at it, accept it. we can&rsquo;t mourn. or, rather, we replace mourning with a facsimile, one that doesn&rsquo;t ask us to make sacrifices, that tells us we can still live in luxury while the world crumbles around us. sometimes i think we&rsquo;re living in a drive-by ecocide. may our electric vehicles save us while we continue down the narrow road of the anthropocene.


i&rsquo;ve ridden in a car three times this summer. all three were to and from parties. i try not to take cars places if i can avoid it; i don&rsquo;t want to contribute to the pollution and danger cars bring to my city, and i don&rsquo;t want to be a patron to ride-sharing apps that exploit precarious gig workers while consolidating power into venture capitalist portfolios. but this is also a result of my privilege; as an able bodied male presenting person, i feel safe biking around brooklyn at night. as a new yorker, i have 24/7 public transportation that can take me home nearly anywhere i end up. in the majority of this country, cars are a necessity. for many of the visitors to greenwood cemetery, too. and besides, it feels good to ride in one. i&rsquo;ll readily admit that i deeply miss blasting music in a car, windows down, singing along.


but this fact about me is very unamerican. it&rsquo;s one of many unamerican things about me (i&rsquo;m mostly proud of this). it&rsquo;s also partially a product of the fact that, since coming back from brazil in may, i have only left the city limits one time (a quick jaunt to princeton for a convening). i&rsquo;m happy with this; there&rsquo;s so much of the city that i still love to get to know. i see in some others i know &mdash; and, at times, in myself &mdash; a kind of positioning oneself as always poised to leave. coworkers share how they can&rsquo;t wait to get out of new york for a trip. friends mention that the best part of new york is leaving and then coming back. i&rsquo;m not sure i agree, and i particularly want to maneuver myself away from this position. i see it in relation to car dependence, this idea that the best place is always some other. that an escape or a leaving will get you where you want to go. not that these aren&rsquo;t necessarily true, but they aren&rsquo;t categorically true, and traveling for the sake of traveling (just like many things that typify the corporate professional class) falls into the very trap of capitalist myopia and dissatisfaction. we could use more pondering.


i&rsquo;ve been staying in new york because i&rsquo;m so enamored by the experience of getting to know this place, truly, thoroughly. i want to live deeply in this city, and it keeps surprising and satisfying me on a nearly daily basis. this isn&rsquo;t to say that i&rsquo;m never going to leave (i&rsquo;m actually spending a week in colorado at the end of the month, soooo don&rsquo;t take my words too seriously), but that i&rsquo;m fiercely dedicated to orienting myself towards the city, rather than away from it.


in my last trip (sunday) to greenwood cemetery i stumbled upon some beehives, so i sat and watched for a while. mostly, i was struck by the setting. not only does beekeeping in a cemetery evoke imagery of haunted honey that i find delightful, but the beehives were right next to a series of cut up logs, around four feet in diameter, scattered about like bones of a prehistoric fossil. how peculiar, this form of death, in this land that houses death, right next to houses for a new form of life. it feels a bit obvious, put this way, like some aspiring fiction writer&rsquo;s clumsy symbolism.<span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space" >&nbsp;</span><em >of course,</em><span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space" >&nbsp;</span>life and death is a cycle. still, i sat and i pondered.

<span class="caption">you can&#39;t really tell in this pic but these babies are absolutely buzzing</span>


the beehives look like filing cabinets. that&rsquo;s what i thought they were, at first, right next to those log-bones and a rusted fence. i thought i&rsquo;d found the junkyard part of the cemetery, thought<span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space" >&nbsp;</span><i>who are the poor souls laid to rest here?</i><span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space" >&nbsp;</span>then revised; i would love to be buried in a junkyard, so long as there&rsquo;s minimal plastic, which i find to be the most unholy material. but no, these aren&rsquo;t filing cabinets, though they look awfully similar. sitting under a tree watching the bees fly in and out of their hives, i think that when i die, i want my everything to be repurposed. my body yes, give it to science or the forest or any old fungi who will take me. but i mean my everything; i want my clothes turned into quilts, my bookshelves to beehives. i want to be in service of the earth.


the cemetery undergoes it&rsquo;s own repurposing, too, as a public space in nyc. certified as an arboretum, greenwood cemetery hosts sculptures and music events and environmental education services. i first visited it on a typography tour as a part of<span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space" >&nbsp;</span><a href="https://2023.typographics.com/" >the typographics festival</a>. the cemetery also serves as a place for<span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space" >&nbsp;</span><a href="https://harpers.org/2019/04/green-wood-cemetery-problematic-statues/" >repurposing old statues</a>, such as Civic Virtue, in which a stone man stands tall quite literally upon a pair of women said to represent corruption and vice. it&rsquo;s had many lives in many more high-profile locations around new york, and now it lives in the cemetery, alongside a strangely condescending plaque.


sites where repurposing occurs are some of the most generative; they show us the exciting potential of combining complex dynamics to create something new. but i think they work best when they&rsquo;re lively, when they&rsquo;re not trying to be secluded or cordoned off from the world. it&rsquo;s why artifacts in museums tend to feel lifeless, why putting Civic Virtue in the middle of a south brooklyn cemetery doesn&rsquo;t really work for anyone. it&rsquo;s also why cities work so well. at their best, cities are places undergoing constant repurposing, as the scaffolding of zoning and history are reimagined by people creating a life for themselves. i&rsquo;m thinking of my visits to memento park in budapest, where communist-era statues have been re-homed, not because of the value of the dialogue the park was proposing to engage in, but because it felt like an interesting setting for people to hang out. and for teenagers to make out.

<span class="caption">nothing like a secluded creepy park to make for a stellar date (i am serious about this)</span>


shiny new developments in cities fail to integrate, because they&rsquo;re premised on the simplistic logic of capitalism, which claims that by simply providing exactly what people might want, they will be made into happy, docile citizens. yes, their needs may be met, but people crave a history in their life, a feeling like they aren&rsquo;t just an agent in a simulation. plopping a whole foods in a new development enforces distance between the resident and the land relations their presence is founded upon, just like driving in a cemetery enforces some distance between the passenger and the death/mourning around them. all our relations become commodity relations.


part of giving myself over to be repurposed means giving myself over to decomposition. and decomposition means breaking something down. it means rot, decay. i want whole foods to rot. better yet, i want to see it repurposed, made anew as a place for mutual aid. i want the same for the cars in the cemetery. it&rsquo;s life in pursuit of decomposition. it&rsquo;s what vanessa machado de oliveira calls<span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><em>hospicing modernity,</em><span class="gmail-Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>in which we prepare for and practice for the death of modernity. and it is, perhaps, what sobu kohso calls &ldquo;the rediscovery of the Earth amidst the decomposition of the World.&rdquo; i&rsquo;m not interested in delving into revolutionary philosophy right now, but i am interested in the connections between my life (pondering in the cemetery, refusing car culture) and possibilities for decomposition. i think of my life as a constant experiment in living well, and to me living well means resisting and decomposing that which limits me and others from what life could be. i&rsquo;m still figuring out what exactly that means, but i want to try continually orienting myself towards repurposing, and see where it takes me. maybe, one day, i&rsquo;ll be a part of repurposing this country. or, at least, greenwood cemetery.
