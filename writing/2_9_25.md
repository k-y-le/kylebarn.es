i’m at the cafe, with plants spilling down from the ceiling. sipping a cardamom coffee with homemade oat milk, i remember how last time i was here peter called this place a set from a slice-of-life brooklyn movie. i’d call it cliche, but there’s a little german girl swaying side to side to the music. paul mccartney, check my machine. there’s something so magical about the way kids dance, like they just stepped into this body and are figuring out how all the parts work. and, true, they are, but i’m also just starting to figure out how my parts work, so why don’t i dance so freely on a sunday morning? the girl exclaims loudly when her mom pulls out a piece of dried mango and offers it to her.

last night, i drew a cat in the snow, so i could see it from my bedroom window, followed the flakes as they drifted down to bury it. this morning, i watched the super shovel away its echo. back inside, i danced to [a song from 2002](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5rqNyulfsQ) in the kitchen. fell asleep while devouring [a new book](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/0489a7df-2a31-4997-aa7f-f8da11a7bfe6).

to be so small, so excited. to stomp to the beat in your bright pink snow boots. to delight at plants housed in old coffee cans. to draw pictures in the snow and to watch them disappear as quickly as they got here. to hold a big piece of dried mango in your hand and sway side to side.
