​wednesday night, and the hot summer air weighs heavily upon me. i&rsquo;m sitting at brooklyn bridge park, looking out over the cityscape on the horizon. i&rsquo;ve got my headphones on, even though i don&rsquo;t wear them very much in the summer since i don&rsquo;t like it when my ears sweat, because i want to feel drowned out by the music. i want to be taken over by this feeling, this sensation of smallness in the face of the city, the hudson, the subway train rumbling overhead. there&rsquo;s this line of my favorite sylvan esso song where she sings &ldquo;turning twisting until we can run out, go swimming&rdquo; and i play it over and over in my head, tracing currents in the water. i haven&rsquo;t been swimming in weeks, really, haven&rsquo;t given myself over to the water &mdash; or anything, much. i&rsquo;ve been tightly in control, lately, asking myself questions and remaining fiercely dedicating to doing what my body asks of me. i&rsquo;ve been stable and efficient, completing tasks and constantly weighing my options. i haven&rsquo;t run out, gone swimming, i haven&rsquo;t let anything wash over me. my head has been constantly above water, and while my life has been splendid by any metric, i find myself tiring of always being in control.


i&rsquo;m getting bitten, and it reminds me that this hottest humid summer makes for a flourishing mosquito population. great for the mosquitos, terrible for me. i should&rsquo;ve remembered my bug spray, i think, before recalling that i don&rsquo;t own any. it&rsquo;s because some part of me likes being bitten &mdash; a reminder that i&rsquo;m of this world, not just looking at it. offering myself up to the mosquitos feels like a small way of loosening control over my own life. in the end i&rsquo;m just food. somehow, that&rsquo;s comforting.


i&rsquo;m always imagining dystopia, forecasting future catastrophe. but my life is not a YA novel. i&rsquo;ve been experiencing a feeling i like to call post-epic emptiness. after watching an epic film (in this case, oppenheimer) or reading an epic fantasy novel (in this case, the way of kings) i&rsquo;m struck by how empty my life feels. it&rsquo;s empty of world-ending conflict and life or death situations. empty of a great love. i haven&rsquo;t been bestowed a magnificent power. i leave these mind-states and return to mundanity. i have to send more emails.


i think this dissonance between the drama of the stories we tell and the regularity of everyday life fuels a trend of making the boring romantic. we try to make our everyday experiences into something notable.&nbsp;<em >you have to start romanticizing your life</em>&nbsp;goes the tiktok trend. that&rsquo;s from back when i had tiktok. now i don&rsquo;t and i&rsquo;ve lost some of the romance, too, i guess, but i gained it in other places. i think that life, for most people, tends to be boring but without boredom. by which i mean, the activities tend to be boring, but there&rsquo;s not actually stretches of open time with which to get bored. mostly, this is due to the overload of media fed to us through social platforms. we have infinite opportunity to consume. you have to seek out boredom, these days.


boredom is a fissure. a rupture in the daily Scroll. on monday i saw some graffiti that said&nbsp;<em >that pain you feel is capitalism dying,</em>&nbsp;and i went,&nbsp;<em >okay&hellip;</em>&nbsp;i think it&rsquo;s more piecemeal than that. more of us end up cut on the jagged edge of late capitalism as it finds new configurations to capture our attention. we&rsquo;re living in a raggedy age; boredom opens up space for new ways of living. Sara Ahmed: &quot;But &#39;getting lost&#39; still takes us somewhere; and being lost is a way of inhabiting a space by registering that it&#39;s not familiar: being lost can in its turn become a familiar feeling.&rdquo;


i&rsquo;ve been looking to fissures, eager for possibility. i&rsquo;m reminded of the sidewalks of mexico city, which tended, more often than not, to be dominated by tree roots run amok, rupturing concrete. some combination of overrun vegetation and frequent earthquakes conquers our ability to flatten the earth in our image. and it does feel like a conquering; this is one of those epic-battles i wish of my own life, playing out under my feet. why can&rsquo;t i feel this way, like i&rsquo;m the tree or the sidewalk, i wonder?

i&rsquo;m going to marry my malaise. it&rsquo;s my forever companion. on one shoulder, malaise, on the other, grief. i pride myself in my insatiable curiosity for the world, my willingness to always explore new ways of living well, but the malaise stays with me. maybe i&rsquo;ll throw a party. this suspension is another water-feeling, like i&rsquo;m caught in a current and unable to see an escape. i&rsquo;m not running out, going swimming, i&rsquo;m watching the water pool around me. my toes begin to wrinkle; dampness pervades.


when do i inhabit the cracks? and feel myself linger. a life constantly taking the smooth path tends to gloss over, becoming smooth and, well, boring. my coworker asks me&nbsp;<em>what&rsquo;s new?</em>&nbsp;and for the fourth time this week, i don&rsquo;t know what to answer. plenty is new, my life feeling like an accelerationist dream, but none of it rises to the surface. i&rsquo;m stuck, but not in a crevasse. i&rsquo;m stuck striding confidently down the path of my life. i leave the park bitten. carry these marks with me. so too does the earth, scarred by our collective steps. to love is to be changed, to love is to stretch into life. as i make my way home, legs beginning to itch, i lose my rigidity, my lingering claim to stability. i&rsquo;m melting, and not just from the heat, finding my way into the cracks of my life, where i&rsquo;ll roost until it&rsquo;s time to move on and find another rupture to inhabit.
