there’s this helena deland song that i love called *spring bug* which i’ve been listening to on repeat. it starts like this: *bitten by a spring bug / it gets me every time / this year i’m on my own and the buzz is all mine.* one of those songs that seems to particularly speak to my phase of life, it’s been soundtracking my bike rides around brooklyn. i made a playlist called [*buzz, all mine*](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5udfpju3v1PO8CrUc14V5I?si=a227e206a8bb464e), with songs that carry this energetic sense of bounty that spring brings, while still retaining a touch of slower melancholy.

i don’t know if it’s spring or summer or some between season right now. i keep trying to get a grasp on it (time), but it continues to slip through my fingers. every week is something new, and i assign it meaning, try to capture it in a word. last week was my Week of Playground, punctuated by a full-day treasure hunt and a pillow fort party going late into the night. this past weekend, my Weekend of Drugs — shrooms on saturday, mdma on sunday. now we’re entering into the Summer of Serendipity. i keep throwing these phrases into the air, seeing which catch the wind and which fall back to me. i’ve always been resistant to writing narratives about my life, fearing the reduction that necessarily accompanies legibility in the watchful eye of capital. yet here i am, narrativizing. a lot.

*this bitch loves to make grandiose claims to locate themself in the nebulous fabric of time!*

simply put, my life is quite wonderful right now. i feel caution even writing this now, conditioned as i am to couch every positive claim with a caveat about privilege, or the suffering of others. but part of living well is owning it when the living is good. and it’s real good, full of friendship and laughter and dancing and laying in the grass. i suppose i’m writing because i want to share in this joy, and practice in claiming it. it’s something that, as a certified People Pleaser, i’m not accustomed to. i’m not so used to believing that i deserve it when good things happen to me.

an aspect of this season i tend to forget is the abundance of tiny bugs flying through the air. every bike ride, i end with spots of green fellas clinging to my shirt, probably whisked away from where they were before without really understanding why. i imagine them bewildered, suddenly whisked away to a completely new world. i don’t know the names of these creatures, as they don’t know the name of me. but we’re brought together by the strange blooming that is spring in new york city, where it seems as though every sidewalk crack is fertile ground for life to emerge from.

it’s a fruitful metaphor, because i feel as though my sidewalk cracks, too, are becoming rich with ruderal species. by this i mean the parts of myself paved over by fear over being perceived a certain way, parts that are clinging to manufactured ideas of humanness and success, parts that remain attached to schemes of normativity. an artful life, to me, is one in which these cracks are widened and broken into, offering new space for something fertile to replace the rigidity modernity offered me.

this is a fanciful way of putting it. mostly, i am just enjoying my life. olivia and i keep repeating this phrase to each other: *to be cringe is to be free.* it feels to me like a way to coach myself to be ok with the lack of general appeal to the type of art that we’re creating. while tripping, olivia notes that what we do while sober isn’t so different than what someone does while on shrooms, and it’s true. we’re laying face first in the grass, barking at groups of dogs, climbing trees, and touching each others’ toes anyways, the substances just augment the experience.

*olivia and i discovering that one of the best ways to draw is to color on your friend. a pleasant experience for the both of you! tattoos make it even more fun*

earnestness can be cringe, i think, because it’s vulnerable. we seem to live in a world where admitting your deep need for connection to the human and more-than-human is generally uncool. i want to continue to work on creating spaces in which people feel comfortable eroding some of the barriers they’ve built up around doing cringey things, which usually means something wild, or something whimsical, or playful. in pursuit of the authentic relationship to the vibrantly-alive world around us, many end up leaning on extremes that offer to ease their inhibitions — often in the form of alcohol, or expensively disappointing events. capitalism is a parasite in the human pursuit of freedom; there’s no alternative to the cringey path, even if money makes it seem like you can buy your way around it.

i set out to write today because i wanted to share some more concrete anecdotes on my life in this new season, yet of course ended up theorizing my way towards an artful life. this, too, is part of it all — we end up in unexpected places, when we start down a path without a fixed destination. anyways, here are some pictures of me from the past month or so.

*i like this picture because it seems like i’m leaving some techno party but i actually was just 30 minutes previous screaming “*DOWN WITH THE AMERICAN EMPIRE”* while popping champagne at paxtī’s pillow fort themed 30th bday party*

*dancing in the moonlight is cringe! and free!*

*visited samm in philly and my aunt in williamsport. it was the first time i left the city limits of nyc in nearly six months (!) and a good reminder of just how big and different this country is. also, we look hot.*
