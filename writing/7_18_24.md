note: i always have about 12 essays lingering at 90% completion, and some of them then contain odd references to bygone current events. i wrote this a few weeks ago, but finally got around to finishing it now. i have a tendency towards noncompletion, something like anti-perfectionism, where i drop things without finishing the last mile of effort. oops!

about once every few months i develop an obsession with geography games. it’s partly about nostalgia, and partly about procrastination, and partly about sharpening a skill i care about. i’m proud to be really adept with geography; i can name every country, capital city, major mountain range, largest lakes, etc. mostly, i just find it really fun. i think it fulfills the serotonin receptors in my mind uniquely shaped to be only satisfied with the rush of standardized testing. american education system, this is your fault.

interesting that i use the word proud to describe my relationship to geography, when just yesterday i ended up getting everyone at the pride potluck to play cityguesser with me. (i had supporters, since meher neeta and i played it into the night on wednesday). [cityguesser](https://virtualvacation.us/guess) is an online game where you guess the location of a first-person video, taken at eye level, of a person walking through a random city. i love this game because it feels a bit like traveling, like understanding the clues that denote a particular location. it gives glimpses into similarities and differences across the world, and the twin clues of locale and obfuscations of globalization. who knew that manila has neighborhoods which looks strangely similar to miami? i didn’t, until this game.

it’s not the same as the embodied experience of visiting a place, but cityguesser feels to me like an example of a type of technology that i love: that which offers a new form of experience. i disagree with narratives about the potential of something like virtual reality to supplant a relationship with nature, or embodied experience of travel. but cityguesser is something that doesn’t offer the replacement of an experience of walking through a city, and instead encourages us to draw connections across the differences of that near-universal human experience of moving through built landscape. i’m thinking about these playful moments of understanding as something i want to see more of, that i want to cultivate. i’m thinking of cityguesser as ludic network mapping. i’m thinking about power, and borders, and when the arbitrary becomes instantiated. i’m thinking about educational games.

cityguesser takes direct inspiration from [geoguessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/), the first (as far as i know) of a genre of educational web game. like the thousand wordle [spinoffs](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/), it’s a variation on a theme. but geoguesser is paywalled now, the simplicity of being dropped in a random street view location now obscured by countless gamification tactics. it’s like a private equity firm got ahold of it, promised profitability and shareholder returns. these things fall apart; a simple thing corrupted by capital, or dead. is this the fate of our beloved childhood computer games? will [coolmathgames](https://www.coolmathgames.com/) last forever? does everything need to be revived in a [fan-run version](https://www.toontownrewritten.com/) in order to survive?

*...take me back...*

human centered design is no more. or, human centered design gets expensive. or, human centered design was never real. and maybe that’s the thing, that the human is no longer what we thought it was, incentives shifting to follow profit. the algorithm is the human.

the most important digital products, for me, are those which are designed to stay the same. consistency is key, they say. how did we lose track of this axiom in the rush to move quickly and break things? why is technology so shitty? i’ve been thinking about this lately as i try to be intentional about getting a new phone. my old iphone 10 (not that old! six years is not long for such an expensive piece of tech…) is falling apart, another victim felled by apple’s planned obsolescence. i’m considering getting the [light phone](https://www.thelightphone.com/), or a [dumb phone](https://www.reddit.com/r/dumbphones/), or anything else. but i probably won’t, because i still want the ease that comes with being in the apple ecosystem, and even if i don’t use my phone much, the things i use it for remain an integral part of my daily life. i find myself frustrated by the lack of good options in front of me, stuck again by a state of suspended agency. what if we treated each other like companies treat our devices and products? designed to fail, unreliable, solely sources of money and psychological manipulation. oh, wait.

one of my favorite products to actually use is [are.na](https://www.are.na/kyle-barnes/channels), because it feels like something that was designed to last. the simple interface doesn’t change much, and the developers have made promises to not take VC money or sell to advertisers. i feel better about creating archives in my arena than i do about my practice of archiving spotify playlists, because spotify feels like an unstable & precarious platform, constantly changing to meet some new financial target. they keep trying to push features on me (smart shuffle, podcasts) that i don’t want to use. i’m so frustrated, because now i feel locked into a platform that is changing for the worse. but i trust arena not to go this way, and even if it does, i am able to have a connection to the founders, so they’re more likely to listen to my complaints. 

what i’m mostly looking for is consistency of the little places for me to explore my interests. with other people, too. i was a geography bee kid, obsessed with my atlases, and i want to stay in touch with that side of myself, that more simple kyle that truly loved to learn things. not bogged down by ad-ridden websites and unexpected paywalls. instead, i’m looking around for places to put my insatiable curiosity about the world. i swear i still have it! even when the structure of my life makes it hard to focus on it. i think i reference those memes every week, the ones that are like “i have to learn X, i have to learn Y”.

one joy of getting older is revisiting those old obsessions, and rethinking what’s possible with them. how my previous assumptions (maps are constant) are quickly disproven, proven to be on (literally) shaky terrain. i’ll write more about it someday, but thus originates my deep interest in radical mapping and cartography. i’m beginning to question what cannot be mapped, what should not be mapped, and what ways power — literally — maps onto the world. what a joy it is to get older and see yourself and your relationship to an interest transform.
