i like when people use the metaphor of “juggling a lot right now” because it really does feel like that. i hold one thing and the others go up in the air. i don’t know how to juggle, but i briefly learned how when i was 14 or so. 

it’s cloudy today, and my toe hurts (ambitious attempt at using it in a plank this morning). i feel like i keep telling everyone about how i rearranged my room and its because it feels so damn good. i don’t know how to explain it better. i feel like the norway maple outside my window. its leaves mostly yellow, its leaves mostly fallen. i wonder if it feels good, to send off the last of the leaves? i wonder if there’s a lightness, like the first walk after a big haircut. like changing up your home, seeing it anew. 

sometimes everything feels new, and it hurts, like when my nephew gets sunlight in his eyes and starts to thrash. you will learn to love this sweetness, i want to tell him. you will learn to let your leaves go.
