at the soup kitchen, i do a shift with a manifestation queen. she coos to me about her book club’s latest venture into astral projection literature. skeptical, she’s asking “is he actually astral projecting, or just lucid dreaming?” i add her to the moon bulletin. she sends me her youtube channel.

i find myself curious about our capacity to relate across our seemingly vastly different worldviews. later, i tell someone that i have one foot in the woo woo, while she’s actively swimming in it. i can imagine the pathway that leads to my becoming a manifestation queen myself — crystals covering my windowsills, conversations increasingly punctuated with references to mercury retrograde. i’m both drawn to and cautious of this trajectory, which seems to me a lesson in the human urge (need?) for connection to larger arcs of mysticism and natural systems, while dangerously disconnected from the tangible, the material, the real. i don’t hold judgement toward the woo woo (okay, maybe a little…), it’s more than i’m concerned about its tendency to float away from the gravity of lived experience.

recently, i’ve read anna tsing’s 2002 book *friction: an ethnography of global connection.* a precursor to her famous-among-queer-nerds *mushroom at the end of the world,* in *friction,* tsing moves through an analysis of complex systems and their differentiated impacts across physical and social landscapes of Indonesia and the globe. it’s wide ranging: she covers the complexities of Indigenous identity in central Borneo, the construction of environmental activist movements across histories of repression in Jakarta, and speculative global mining finance between Canadian-American-Indonesian actors. i loved this book, which is unsurprising if you’ve ever heard me gush about tsing’s analysis before. i feel so fortunate to have picked up a used copy from unnameable books, like it was meant to find me.

in chapter four of *friction,* tsing examines nature lovers groups in Indonesia — essentially a site of identity formation for youths seeking community among the extrication of urbanization and the reverberations of repressive political tactics. rural students would arrive at urban universities, and “remake themselves in relation to the beauty, the skills, the danger, and the leadership opportunities of nature loving.”

i’ve been wondering about this phenomenon in the context of my own life, thousands of miles away in brooklyn. nature loving as a source of identification is hardly a new concept, and has taken shifting forms since western philosophy allied with the elite class of emergent capitalists to sever big m Man and big n Nature from each other. but there are forms of its current manifestation that trouble me, for ways that i’m hoping to explore. one example is this brand named [usal](https://www.usalproject.com/) — a trendy LA-based outdoorsy company making gear that’s more diy and artful than the tried-and-true patagonia/north face/rei aesthetic. it’s nature loving with an urban coolness, a nostalgic set of references to countercultural californian aesthetics. i only actually discovered this brand when they showed up with a film photographer to the mcgolrick bird club, the outcome of which seems to be a picture of ben and i on the first slide of a carousel on the bird club’s instagram. presumably usal is using these images for something? somehow? i’m not really sure; it was 9am and i mostly just wanted to look at birds.

*brief stint as greenpoint influencers*

there’s a larger cultural movement revolving around reconnection to nature (the re is important) in light of catastrophic climate change fueling brands like usal, if indirectly. we are all scrambling to find our place within failing ecosystems, to reforge identities in relation to the ever-looming threat of climate collapse. capitalism is, of course, there to offer us the first cookie in our search, selling us an identity kit complete with the right pants for hiking, the right water bottle (never mind that you already have 10) for plastering with stickers about how much you love hiking and your tech company and your elite liberal arts college, the right beanie for looking contemplative against a sunset backdrop. (looking at you, arctery’x). this feels important to track. attending to how these types of consumption come to life reveals much about how resilient any promises of a “return to nature” really are. i don’t want to be seduced by capitalist formations of a connection to nature, i want to live it.

here’s tsing: “it is an appreciation of cultural specificity that gives us critical distance from the common sense platitudes and everyday assumptions of our lives, as well as the powerful ideologies that keep us in their thrall.” i am cautious of the nature-based ideologies that i find myself susceptible to. me, nature lover. brooklyn alt gay kid. someone invested in the future of nature-culture relations. conversant in climate science and climate tech. elite educated. someone with perhaps too much knowledge of the wretchedness of our climate futures.

reconfiguring a relationship with nature is an admirable goal, and one that branches off rather quickly into divergent paths. there’s the back-to-the-land trad wife. the usal LA eco-bro. the north face normie. (i am not trying to be mean).

in college, i witnessed several types of these nature lover groups, though of course they’re culturally specific to the west, the US northeast, and the ivy league in their own ways. yet they still share characteristics with their indonesian counterparts. one was outdoor action, focused on trips and leadership in backpacking and wilderness survival. the other was conservation societ, aimed more at environmental preservation through organized action/events. my own journey of figuring out my relationship to nature has been strongly influenced by my understandings and engagements with these groups — feelings, mostly, of alienation.

*me canoeing the delaware river remaking george washington pic for some reason idk i was 17 dont ask questions*

the conservation society felt alienating to me because it seemed to resemble more of a consumption society, oriented around expensive trips to national parks that fed into cosmopolitan identity formation tropes. it always felt a bit too escapist, too disconnected from the day-to-day reality of environmental degradation happening in our own backyards. it was, too, a bit old-fashioned, in its connections (both explicit and implicit) to the [problematic past](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26169802?mag=how-conservation-is-shaped-by-settler-colonialism&seq=1) of the conservation movement itself. 

outdoor action, on the other hand, felt more rugged, closer to home. but it carried this awful summer camp energy that i could never fully embrace — forced fun, compounding inside jokes, a standardized peppiness that felt oppressively cheerful. i have never felt comfortable in the summer camp space, no matter how i tried, and couldn’t shake the feeling that the forced cheeriness was clouding any possibility for meaningful connection. even when conversations turned serious, the in-group/out-group dynamics pervaded everything.

with the slightly critical distance of a few years out of college, i’m trying to figure out what’s next, in my own way of relating to nature — in a manner that feels authentic to my own experience. 

what i’m interested in: urban ecology, messiness, anti-consumerism, radical environmentalism, non-appropriative eco-ritualism that doesn’t require buying a special mat or candle. 

what i’m not interested in: branded t-shirts announcing my nature loving identity, eco-imperialism disguised as conservation, endless quantification of nature through apps and tracking, escapism that ignores the ecological reality of urban life, naturalist identity politics forging new hierarchies of belonging.

in my life i’ve touched and been touched by many of these forces and, like anyone, i shape my identity in response. my aspiration is to draw from the most resonant ways that people gather around the natural world without losing myself in any particular dogma or prefabricated identity. am i creating my own nature-based ideology? by my own, i mean not just mine, but always co-created with my human and nonhuman interlocutors — the tree outside my window, the community garden, the friends with whom i walk prospect park.

so i return to the manifestation queen from the soup kitchen, to the woo woo that i don’t wholly disidentify with. there’s some opportunity in that framework — maybe there’s something beautiful in believing we can manifest a different relationship with nature, and with each other. maybe there’s something powerful in ritualizing our connections to natural cycles, so long as we still act against the material constraints of climate crisis.

somewhere between the hard materiality of climate science and the ethereal promises of manifestation, i’m trying to find my footing. indonesian students in the 90s were, too, stuck between a rock (massive natural destruction wrought by globalist exploitation following neocolonial routes) and a hard place (a repressive regime that disallowed all political action that threatened its tenuous grip on a portion of the spoils from said globalist exploitation). what happens in those difficult positions is no less than friction, which tsing defines as “the awkward, unequal, unstable, and creative qualities of interconnection across difference”. creative feels like a key word, a bit surprising in its relation to the others. but maybe dwelling with this friction, seeing how we can inspire even more, is how to find our way within the mess. tsing: “friction refuses the lie that global power operates as a well-oiled machine. furthermore, difference sometimes inspires insurrection. friction can be the fly in the elephant's nose.”

i think this is what i mean when i say that i have one foot in the woo woo. i remain at the threshold, in the boundary zones, curious about what lies beyond while trying to remain grounded in what i know to be true of this world, this moment, this particular constellation of relationships between humans and the more-than-human world. somewhere between fashionable nature brands and unbearably corny backpacking groups, maybe i’m making some space as the fly in the elephant’s nose.
