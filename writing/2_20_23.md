hi ! it&rsquo;s february ! glad you&rsquo;re here with me ☻


so first, a note on this newsletter. i&rsquo;ve been wanting to start writing a newsletter for a while. not to fulfill a desire for substack fame or to build a following, but more so as an experiment in sharing my life. i feel limited by the capricious whims of social media as we know it now. i crave a slower, more contemplative way to share. i want to keep my friends involved in my life, particularly those far away. i want a new way to be intellectually legible. i want to keep myself accountable to write as i experience the world. i think it holds promise; i hope you&rsquo;ll indulge me these paragraphs. they&rsquo;ll come at a roughly monthly cadence, offer what i hope to be a fun glimpse into my life, and invite you to reflect and respond (just reply to this email), if you so wish, at your own pace. and, of course, you can always remove yourself from the list.

2023 began, for me, with the pouring rain in a dry place, at the end of the world, or at least the end of this world, by which i mean the end of america, by which i mean los angeles. i emerged cleansed, not least because we visited a 24hr Korean spa in the wee hours of the new year, once we tired of dancing. spirited back to new york city, i&rsquo;ve been finding it hard to get out of bed in the morning. not because i dread the day, but because i&rsquo;ve been falling in love with the delirium of morning coziness, wrapped as i am in my burrito of softness (softness, for me, is currently a top 3 feeling). i&rsquo;ve been indulging, which is always the best thing to do in the dredges of winter, when we&rsquo;re told that new year&rsquo;s resolutions should keep us lean and tensed. indulging for me has meant more baths (with herbal bath salts courtesy of raya &lt;3), more reading and more stretching and extending my body. i let soreness be my companion, which is pretty nice because sometimes it feels like it&rsquo;s just me and my soreness against the world.


but usually not. i feel fortunate to be sharing this life with friends old and new in the city, who buoy me even as my housing situation falls apart and the world falls apart around us, too. it&rsquo;s not that bad; i&rsquo;m doing fine (though i would appreciate any leads on apartments or sublets starting in april &lt;3). but that doesn&rsquo;t stop me from dramatizing my life. we have to! indulgence, drama, romanticization. the sun hits my face and warms a smile. these little moments are thick with aliveness, and perhaps the only reason why i can live in this raggedy age and still feel so in love with life.


a pattern i&rsquo;ve noticed a few times this week, while walking the streets of new york: there are these LinkNYC kiosks with screens that broadcast sports scores, weather, fun facts, food videos, usually found by the side of the street or, at its worst, in a subway car. they&rsquo;re kind of hilarious in their bewildering uselessness. but recently, i&rsquo;ve been stumbling on them broken &mdash; displaying error messages, sideways. it&rsquo;s very cyberpunk; it&rsquo;s very ironic. not even the veneer of the high-tech city can last, its vestigial &ldquo;updates&rdquo; lost to the public, and nobody for the worse because of it. tiktok takes new york.

i can&rsquo;t shake this feeling. that things are getting worse. not even the weak approximation of a Tasty video survives the decay of life as i know it. or, actually, as i never knew it, but as i thought i would know it, one day. many have written on this, many are thinking it.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25510906-the-mushroom-at-the-end-of-the-world" >Anna Tsing</a>: &ldquo;we are stuck with the problem of living despite economic and ecological ruination.&rdquo;&nbsp;the constant feeling that everything is falling apart feels, to me, like the defining feature of our age. i&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out how much of it is me and my friends, as we attempt to make a space for ourselves in this deeply normative, heteropatriarchal neoliberal society (insert your fav academic buzzword here). but then i stumbled upon a youtube recommendation &mdash; 12 million views &mdash; titled something like &ldquo;why does it feel like everything is falling apart&rdquo;. i lost the video to the algorithm (irony? this too shall not last&hellip;), but the point remains. even talking head youtube influencers are finding an audience in talking about the end of the world. at least they&rsquo;re finding a way to make money off of it.


is this what the end of the world looks like? i walk around the city and see colorful LEDs lighting up apartment buildings: gaudy shades of electric blue, lime green, hot pink. at the whitney&rsquo;s Edward Hopper exhibit i comment to a friend that part of the melancholic allure of Hopper&rsquo;s sparse new york is that there are no LEDs adding unforgiving color to the landscape. the monotony of the past never looked so good.

<span class="caption">i feel like she knows a thing or two about vibes</span>


i&rsquo;m developing a hatred for customizable lighting; i propose a mandatory class on ambiance. sometimes i come home and my roommates are sitting in harsh overhead lighting. i turn it off, i hope they don&rsquo;t hate me for it, but i can&rsquo;t keep living like this. it feels like a symptom of the fall &mdash; maybe the earth is punishing us for our chronic bad vibes.



something that would help: snow. i want it to snow! i want it to pile up and trap me inside and soften the sounds of the city. i want to see it everywhere and, yes, i even want the gray slush two days later&nbsp;that every other person in the city loves to rage against. things just aren&rsquo;t like they used to be, and it&rsquo;s not even witty or funny to claim it as a side effect of climate change anymore. we all know this. add changing weather to the list of things too banal to bring up at the dinner party at the end of the world. it fits nicely right next to school shootings, toxic rail accidents, and rising mental health issues.


i&rsquo;m being dramatic. i can&rsquo;t get this out of my mind. i write this so i can look it in the eye.&nbsp;<i>the end is near.</i>&nbsp;but then, in the first week of the&nbsp;<a href="http://tomorrowsoup.com/" >tomorrow soup</a>&nbsp;book club meeting, while discussing Kathryn Harlan&rsquo;s delightfully uncanny story&nbsp;<i>Algal Bloom,</i>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m reminded that decay often means growth. algae blooms as temperatures rise. death leaves space for life, like with the proliferation of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/29/dining/blank-street-coffee.html" >VC-backed Blank Street Coffees</a>&nbsp;popping up in storefronts vacant after covid-era struggles. thriving happens here, too. it just doesn&rsquo;t always make much sense.


i&rsquo;m trying to make this a time of blooming. i&rsquo;ve always found the most beauty at the periphery. what&rsquo;s inspiring me? a visit to the&nbsp;<a href="https://interspecieslibrary.com/" >interspecies library</a>, as a reminder that you can actually just have a passion and go for it, and if your passion rings true, you may find yourself building a community.


i visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/theaster-gates-young-lords-and-their-traces" >new museum Theaster Gates exhibit</a>&nbsp;on a saturday. riding the elevator, i begin to hear echoes of organ through the walls. a serendipitous performance absolutely transforms a show that i already thought of as one of the best i&rsquo;ve ever seen. i&rsquo;m reminded that art has power, that art transforms, that art, when done well, creates conversations that we should all be having, that we should all be fortunate enough to enter.


i make soup (butternut squash ofc) for my dear friend Keely. i go skating in prospect park on a monday morning (don&rsquo;t tell my boss). i organize a food drive at work. i watch the Hunger Games: Catching Fire movie, for some reason. these simple things feel like luxuries. i&rsquo;m really living. i hope you are too ☻
