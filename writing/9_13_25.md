birthday this weekend. turning 27 (wow). i’m nervous! birthdays are hard; it used to be that september 14th was without fail my least favorite day of the year. but as with most things, as i get older, i’ve become more attuned to making a good life out of my days. the last few years, since moving to new york, i’ve found my birthday to be a sweet joyous affair. 

i’m trying to be more confident in sharing my art. i like to make things, often, and i want this to remain an uncomplicated part of my life. i’m not aiming for recognition or approval, necessarily, but i think my hesitancy stems from a deep seated devaluing of creative pursuits. the past year, as i’ve found more supportive spaces and people to fill my life, my creative outputs have increased. yay! among a wide range of creations emerging from my past month in the mountains, i am perhaps most proud of this little book i wrote. it’s called *things the mountain told me: notes on cyborg spiritualism.* it’s eight chapters, each following a being on the mountain (hummingbird, thistle, iron, creek, etc). i designed it and printed it, too — it looks really good, feels really good, if you ask me.

*sneak peek!! this is the vibe... if anyone wants to teach me how to take nice pics of the things i make.. please i need your help*

it takes a similar style to most of this newsletter. if i had to compare it to any well-known authors, it’s probably most similar to robin wall kimmerer, who is such an inspiration for me. the book project was an opportunity to go a bit deeper into some of the philosophies and ideas that motivate me, and to deepen a relationship with the place i was spending my time. i’ve been letting myself imagine a future life in which this kind of approach to writing is core to my practice: meeting places and people (not necessarily human people!) and exploring my relationship to them through writing. 

i feel really good about this book, though i don’t think it’s my best writing. i think it speaks to how i see the world, how i am ongoing in my attempts to understand what living well really means. across the mountain beings i investigate, i bring in big concepts for how i’ve lately been thinking about the world. they are, quite literally, things the mountain told me (with the help of some pivotal thinkers). as a preview, some ideas i’m thinking-with are:

- the cyborg: of course! thank you donna haraway, what fun to think as a cyborg from amongst seemingly un-cyborgian landscapes of pristine alpine meadows and rocky cliffs
- the pastoral fantasy: this is what i’ve been naming as the fantasy of a return to pre-industrial nature. it’s seductive, and i think it worms its way into how we talk about and think about things like climate and community in manners we tend to overlook.
- shimmer: i learned this from aspen groves, and from deborah bird rose, who herself learned it from the Yolgnu Aboriginal people. shimmer as in brilliance, as in shifting, as in always-in-motion.
- assemblages: i’m lowkey in my philosophy era, so this one can get dense. turns out the philosopher guys were onto something! i do really like this way of connecting entangled systems, courtesy of deleuze and guattari. but also have to mention that Indigenous ontology has been working with this concept for centuries. get on it, french people!

it’s going to be a very earnest way to spend my birthday. i’ve been wrestling with two anxieties about it. one is that nobody is interested in the things i have to say. the other is that it’s narcissistic, to be like “come look at my art” when a birthday party is usually so much more chill. but, first of all, it’s my birthday, so i can do what i want. and, also, i want the gatherings i host to reflect how i live in the world. so on saturday i’ll be putting up a bunch of watercolors, cyanotypes, and sharing a zine alongside the aforementioned book. it’s an ample spread from what was a fruitful retreat to the mountain. if you’re nyc based, i hope to see you there, hope to share the celebration of some of my life with yall.

for those friends who aren’t, if you’re interested in my little book, [here’s a link to order it](https://forms.gle/1xMj41keMtiRH24RA) (in the very official manner of a cobbled together google form), or my much more silly zine: *stuff i put in my notes app for some reason* (also pictured below). shipping cost is tbd, i’m doing this very diy! but charging because it costs a bunch to print the books, and because i’m trying to honor the time and effort that i put into this writing/designing/printing process. doing all this, and reflecting on my many previous zine/design projects, i realize that in a way i’ve started a small publishing press of my own. i’m calling it Bad Egg Press, and in the future i’m intrigued by the possibility of helping design and print friends’ projects. so, reach out if you wanna collaborate! as always <3.

*​my notes app is 5000 pieces of my brain and i put like 30 of those in this lil book*

i really feel like a creative person (*capital a Artist*), these days. mostly because i have the time and capacity to put effort towards some of my many creative projects. i’ve been spending some time reflecting on how i’ll look back at this period of my life when i’m much older. and hoping that i feel pride, that i am proud of my decision to devote such energy to diy creative practice. i also hope, and truly believe, that i will look back and continue to feel the tenderness i currently have, towards my friends, towards each of you, for keeping me alight as i co-navigate the twists and turns of living well amongst a world that seems to be falling apart. and, as always, i hope that i can be a resource and companion for yalls journeys, too.

so thank you, each of you, for being a companion in some small or big way as i step into my 27th year of living. i think it’s gonna be a good one! despite the Troubles.
