i’ve been thinking, as always, about the possibilities for long-distance communication, investing in alternatives to social media, and the rich and inspiring history of things like mail art. i also have been making plenty of zines this year, big and small, fancy and simple. i think a zine is a great way to communicate a theme or idea that is surfacing in your life. and i love little more than hearing what my friends have been thinking/creating about! a zine is like a letter, but with some artful component, with a bit more intentionality when it comes to form. 

the zine club is meant to be low commitment - you basically just have to make a bunch of copies of one zine one time in 2026 and send it around. every other month you don’t have to do anything, just read your zine when it comes in the mail! hopefully this will be an opportunity to connect with people in a new way, especially new creative folks you might not have otherwise met! my social life is certainly very nyc-centric, but i’m especially hoping that the group ends up being a mix of folks around the country (probably not international though… because shipping costs… sorry…). this is especially so because i tend to find it difficult keeping up with people who live in different places via digital communication. it also would be sweet to include people who i don’t know, or don’t know well! so if you have any friends or acquaintances who you think would be down, please send them [the link](http://www.kylebarn.es/zineclub).

it’s also on the site i made, but you can also join by responding to this email… hope to see some of yalls zines in my (literal) inbox in 2026! <3
