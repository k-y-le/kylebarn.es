&ldquo;Take a walk at night. Walk so silently that the bottoms of your feet become ears.&rdquo;

i would describe myself as a hobbyist. i&rsquo;m constantly picking up new hobbies, or trying them out, or looking for some new way to make my life into that which constantly brings me joy and awe and surprise. some are longer commitments: soccer, reading media studies, going dancing, writing. and some are more fresh. i like having a balance of things that feel familiar and those which feel like an exploration, an inquisitive prodding into the structure of my life.


something that&rsquo;s taken the form of a hobby, recently, has been dogwatching. by which i mean i literally go to the park (preferably in the morning, 8am is the perfect time), find a spot to sit, and observe the various dogs of my neighborhood walking by. i really love it because it can feel like a morning routine, and because there are truly such a diversity of dog breeds that i see each day. i love to watch how they interact with each other. some are standoffish, some are distracted, others clearly want to play/sniff with every fellow dog they encounter. it&rsquo;s like a cuter form of people watching. plus, sometimes i get to pet them.


i also enjoy this hobby as a practice of observation. it&rsquo;s easy to get caught up in the chaos of life as a young adult in a big city, and carving out time to deliberately avoid devices and distractions (if i&rsquo;m feeling bold i&rsquo;ll leave my phone at home) can feel like a difficult undertaking. but it&rsquo;s not that difficult, really, and the it&rsquo;s fulfilling to feel attuned to my environment. how many of us walk through the streets trying not to be seen, trying to get to our destination as quickly as possible, viewing everything that stops us as an obstacle to be overcome? of course there are valid reasons (like personal safety) to act this way, but i&rsquo;ve found that opening my life up to observation through a simple hobby like dogwatching makes me generally more disposed to curiosity and delight while going through my days. Anna Tsing: <em>Our first step is to bring back curiosity. Unencumbered by the simplifications of progress narratives, the knots and pulses of patchiness are there to explore.</em>

Tsing calls this &ldquo;arts of noticing&rdquo; &mdash; working on our collective ability to slow down, notice the world in its assemblages and interdependencies. one of the recommended methods to cope with eco-anxiety is to work on a stronger connection to place. part of the anxiety of climate crisis, for many of us, comes from an asymmetry in how we understand and get information about our environment. finding methods to practice curious observation of our environment means getting to know it as a complex reflexive system, one that surprises, dazzles, and disgusts. this is important because it imbues our environment with an agency that is missing from dominant environmental narratives. in the theater of climate change, nature is a victim. but it&rsquo;s always more complicated than that. i&rsquo;m not saying that my dogwatching is going to cure my climate anxiety, but that i can and will be deliberate about cultivating a more curious and observant mind, that is malleable to take in the myriad ways &ldquo;nature&rdquo; exists as an agent in the world.

at a party in august, an architect from Colombia shared that he never enjoyed video games growing up, because he always felt that they paled in comparison to the world around him. in particular, he would prefer to spend time in the forest in which his home was, rather than be inside playing games. escapism held no appeal when a better escape was readily available. while some element of this idea reflects a reductive narrative about video games as purely avenues for meaningless escape rather than imaginative potential, the conversation did make me reflect on that which facilitates a curious and observant life. in particular, i was struck by how privilege works in this instance. i don&rsquo;t know the details of his upbringing, but i can assume that there are some accounts by which my own upbringing were more privileged than the architect&rsquo;s. this by virtue of growing up in an affluent american suburb, with american citizenship and a stable family life. at the same time, i loved video games growing up. one part of this love, for me, was the ability to escape into different worlds, ones which were much more exciting than that which was available to me. what privilege, then, to live in an environment so inspiring and beautiful that escape feels like an undesirable future.


it&rsquo;s a very american future, to have resources and privilege, but limited access to beauty. extraction over everything else. is this progress? i&rsquo;m thinking about this meme about plastic dinosaurs. and yet a trace of the true self exists in the false self. sometimes i think this is what america really is. a trace of the true self existing in the false self&hellip; that which attempts to recreate the very thing it has suffocated. this land is beautiful. i don&rsquo;t want to experience it recreated, be it through a painting or VR or a story or a video game. i want to roll around in the dirt and feel it in my pores.

there&rsquo;s something spiritually offensive about a plastic houseplant. like who are we kidding, here? i don&rsquo;t want something that limply attempts to evoke something alive, something real. i don&rsquo;t want to use instagram. i want an heirloom tomato and a garden where all my friends come and we watch as the fireflies come out at dusk before eating a salad and it&rsquo;s sooo crunchy. the thing about this is that i keep fighting for this image of my life, but i also keep falling into the traps laid out in front of me. relations mediated through data-sucking social media platforms, dating via an app that lets me post six pictures about myself, food that has been chemically derived to stimulate my taste buds and make everything else seem dull in comparison.


this is on a personal level, but increasingly my thoughts have been on a larger scale. as usual, i&rsquo;m thinking about the end of the world. i&rsquo;ve recently sensed a bit of a shift in the ways that folks in my circles coming from a more technocratic, neoliberal background are thinking about climate change. there&rsquo;s more optimism here. that america will reach its net zero goals, that innovation is accelerating in important industries and maybe carbon dioxide removal will work and maybe we just might be ok. what i don&rsquo;t understand about it is that this vision of the future seems still so mired in an extractive relationship with the earth. accelerated solutions at the expense of some of what it was attempting to solve for. it still feels like we&rsquo;re being asked to accept just a trace of the true self in the false self. a world papered over with solar panels and direct air capture plants and probably an AI model controlling the whole thing. plastic houseplants for decoration. maybe we do reach net zero, maybe we do remove some of the carbon. but will we be left celebrating in a concrete nightmare?


i&rsquo;m trying to figure out how to demand the true self. a genuine and reciprocal relationship to land and ecology. forms of governance and ownership that enable sustained collective practice. there a simple power to an environmental movement aligned with beauty. it&rsquo;s of course where much of the environmental movement in america is coming from, after years of national parks advocacy and general campaigning around the environment as a question of equal consumption of nature, rather than equitable entanglement with the forces that produce &ldquo;nature&rdquo; as a product or outcome. still, perhaps there&rsquo;s more space for arts of noticing in the ways that climate adaptations are leveraged currently. in particular, i think space for noticing surfaces natural challenges to the tech daydreams climate tech is steering us towards. respecting the beautiful dance of entanglement that produces ecosystems necessarily means finding solutions that uphold said entanglement, rather than bulldoze over it to build a direct-air capture plant which balances the carbon sheet. Robin Wall Kimmerer: <em>Listening in wild places, we are audience to conversations in a language not our own[..]. They remind us of the capacity of others as our teachers, as holders of knowledge, as guides[..]. Imagine the possibilities. Imagine the access we would have to different perspectives, the things we might see through other eyes, the wisdom that surrounds us.</em>


i&rsquo;m interested in orienting my life towards noticing. building up hobbies like dogwatching that mean devoting time to being present in the place that i live. hosting gatherings that prioritize this noticing, like the beetles event that olivia and i hosted in october, which invited others to join us in noticing the wonderful ways beetles crawl into our social, aesthetic, and environmental lives. i&rsquo;m also curious about performances of noticing, and building a practice that lends an aura of importance to everyday acts of noticing (very much inspired by Pauline Oliveros). and i want to build tools that facilitate noticing. things like <a href="https://www.tree.fm/">tree.fm</a>, a website that allows you to listen to a random forest. an observant life is an entangled life. it&rsquo;s also slower, with less time speedily scrolling through social media and more attentively watching a worm on the pavement.

one night in october i went to a dinner party and neiman and michael&rsquo;s, which ended with us watching outside their (floor to ceiling) windows as the pouring rain drenched the park their apartment overlooks. i consider it one of my most special memories since moving to new york. sitting with dear friends, old and new, watching a quintessential scene of urban life, sharing music recommendations. thinking back to moments which have evoked a similar feeling of contentedness, i notice that they&rsquo;re all categorized by a devotion to observation, be it to a living creature, someone&rsquo;s art practice, or the joy of friendship. all my happiest moments come at times where i&rsquo;m being intentional with my attention. i forget this, sometimes, when i become mired in the act of scrolling or anxious about social dynamics. as i seek out new rituals for living well on a damaged planet, i promise to myself to always stay observant.
