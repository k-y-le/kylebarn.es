i’m in berkeley and the trees are so, so tall. they’re making me feel small, aware of my futile animal nature. i (as a not-so-small person) believe that it’s important to feel small. in new york, the buildings make me feel small. the infrastructure. in california it’s the trees. adrienne maree brown: small is good, small is all. (the large is a reflection of the small.)

in texas i didn’t feel small. i felt like i could take up space, extend myself out into the great plains laid out in front of me. it’s part of why i had to leave. smallness is liberating, like how a constraint can induce creativity. i need bounds to know when i end and the world around me begins. in texas i had no sense of awe for the world or for my place within it. i had to look elsewhere, go elsewhere.

california is the conclusion of america. and i think i’m finally beginning to understand. i grew up in the midst of the expanse. in the between. it’s that which does not make me feel small, induces a manifest destiny that i needed to constrain. and so i left to remember what it is to be on the edge. or maybe i was learning, for the first time.

there’s also something here about chaos, and collision. in new york, people and cultures collide at a scale both monumental and limited. california feels that way, too. though the people are less interesting, every other face i see in berkeley a smiling white beard with a baby. but here the biodiversity breathes, pushes at the seams. full to bursting.

i didn’t know this fullness in texas, where what isn’t grass is foreign. it’s why i feel a kinship with the desert, despite rarely going there. the environment back home is austere, texan minimal. being filled up with tract houses and parking lot sprawl. no, give me a tall tree. a collision of difference. i’m here in this different world, this different america.
