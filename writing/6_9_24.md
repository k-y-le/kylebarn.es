last i wrote about the “move fast” part of “move fast and break things,” but i also want to think about breaking things. breaks, cracks, glitches, ruptures and gaps are the most interesting parts about being alive. what happens in between? what happens where something has not been designed? what has happened / what will happen? i could ask a thousand questions; i could break a thousand systems.

breakages suspend time; breakages expose power structures. they are also where exploitation happens, in both the systemic rupture of systems of solidarity and protection, but also in the literal rupture of the earth to extract its resources. if the conditions of mutual abundance are an intellectual battleground, it is because we find ourselves at the precipice of great breakages in society. perhaps people have always felt that way, but i am of my time, and i will not stop living deeply within it. i want (need, even) to be a part of thinking about and acting upon the breakages of our current critical moment in the planet’s future. georgina voss: “And yet – sitting with the breakage is necessary. Harnessing all of this knowledge of how the system works, how it feels, where the stories about it have come from, how it breaks, are necessary, to mend and repair and maintain if we need to; but also to hack it and tear it down; to refuse its power, if we want to.”

perhaps it’s cliche — *of course*, we have to stay with the trouble. but to break is to reveal, and to reveal is to expose, and to expose is to create the space within which something different might be possible. something critical here: we should all feel empowered to come together in breakage. to create the breakages we need to survive. to widen the breakages we need to continue to erode. to fill the space left with something together, by us, for us. to map where the breakages link together to make a better world.

it’s very utopian, and i’ve been tired of the utopia, lately, with its aesthetics of solarpunk urbanism and clean futurism. i keep thinking about the image of a dandelion growing through cracks in the pavement. a weed, but a beautiful one, emerges from breakages in our futile attempts at paving over the world with concrete. what draws me to this is its quotidian messiness. the breakage that can happen everywhere, does happen everywhere, and the perseverance of life to grow in unfavorable conditions. it’s messy too, a “making-do” that speaks more to our probable futures than the sleek electric car or diverse picnic on a rolling hill.

perhaps this is the point i’m keen to make on the “break things” part of zuckerberg’s phrase. we need to practice being more comfortable with the messiness, the muddiness, the grossness of the breakages, because when we try to clean them up, we’re much more likely to end up with a technologically sophisticated ruin than a truly livable future. i see much of my work, both professionally and artistically, as attempting this. in exploring thresholds between disgust and fascination in olivia and my interspecies gatherings, in creating new rituals via moon parties and grief facilitation, in building new technologies for a shared understanding of people and planet through climate science + remote sensing.

what can i break? in 2020, my resolution was to destroy the concept of time. in 2018, i wrote extensively that i wanted to destroy a taxonomy. two weeks ago, i nearly broke my wrist. things are constantly breaking and bristling (the only constant is change). i’m just learning to move with it all; adapt to the difference.
