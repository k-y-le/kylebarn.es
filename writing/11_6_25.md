at the sidewalk study last night, hope and i facilitated a practice on whale fall. that’s when whales die, and their remains drift down to the bottom of the ocean floor, feeding entire ecosystems. hundreds if not thousands of species have specialized for whale fall - it is their life giving force, arriving erratically, bringing abundance to a starving world. it is a stunningly gorgeous phenomenon.

the descent alone can take hours, sometimes days. this massive body, once buoyant and graceful, becoming heavy, pulled down by gravity into the crushing darkness of the abyssal zone. when it finally settles on the seafloor — miles below the surface, in a landscape most humans will never witness — something remarkable begins.

first come the scavengers. hagfish and sleeper sharks, drawn by chemical signals diffusing through the water. they tear into the soft tissue, consuming tons of flesh over the course of months. the water around the carcass becomes cloudy with particles, with the dispersal of what was once whale. this is the mobile-scavenger stage, brutal and efficient.

then the enrichment-opportunist stage. the bones are still rich with lipids, and a whole community moves in. polychaete worms, crustaceans, mollusks — species that might wait decades between whale falls, their entire life cycles synchronized to these rare events. they colonize the skeleton like settlers, like pilgrims, making a home in what remains.

finally, the sulphophilic stage. bacteria begin breaking down the lipids in the bones, producing hydrogen sulfide. this would be toxic to most life, but here in the deep, specialized organisms have learned to metabolize poison into energy. zombie worms — Osedax, the bone-eaters — extend root-like structures into the skeleton, dissolving bone from the inside. they have no mouth, no stomach, no digestive system. just these roots, and symbiotic bacteria living inside them, converting bone into sustenance.

a single whale fall can sustain a community for fifty years or more. in the lightless deep, where food is scarce and life moves slowly, these massive carcasses are oases. entire species exist only in their proximity, have evolved specifically to exploit this resource. they wait in the darkness for a gift from above.

there's something almost sacred about it. the eerie beauty of gardens blooming in the abyss. the patient unraveling of something that was once magnificent into something that feeds hundreds of other forms of magnificence. death as infrastructure. a body becoming a world.

in discussion, someone brings up the idea that the furniture of wealthy people in nyc neighborhoods is like the whale carcass. us starving artist types rush to gobble up, specialize around it. we've all done it. the midnight walks through park slope or cobble hill, eyes scanning the sidewalk for the telltale signs. the facebook groups: "Buy Nothing," "Free Stuff," "Curb Alerts." the texts to roommates: "there's a credenza on 7th ave, looks mid-century, should i get it?" the tetris of fitting a lounge chair into a subway car. the negotiations over who saw it first.

wealthy neighborhoods shed their skin seasonally. spring cleaning. moving day. the end of a lease. the arrival of something newer, more on-trend, more in line with the pinterest board they're currently embodying. out goes the perfectly good couch, the solid wood table, the ikea shelving that's actually the expensive kind. down to the curb it goes, a carcass for the taking.

to that end, i am the bone eating snot flower of park slope. *Osedax mucofloris:* bone eating snot flower. what a name for a creature. what a name to aspire to. it looks, indeed, like a snot flower that would eat bones.

they're barely worms, more like living flowers made of mucus and root systems. they have no eyes, no brain as we'd recognize it. the females anchor to bone and never move again, sending acid-secreting roots deep into the calcium matrix. the males — microscopic, barely more than swimming sperm sacs — live inside the females' tubes. this is their entire existence: dissolving bone, hosting bacteria, reproducing in the dark.

scientists didn't even know they existed until 2002. they'd been down there all along, waiting for whale falls in the benthic zone, living out their grotesque and beautiful lives in complete obscurity. when researchers first saw them under microscopes, they thought they were looking at something alien. and they were, in a way. alien and also perfectly adapted. specialized to the point of strangeness.

i jest, but i do truly identify a bit with being the bone eating snot flower of park slope. my apartment is a whale fall ecosystem — a lamp from cobble hill, a coffee table from down the street. (of the roomies, robin is definitely the one who would survive the longest in the deep ocean - his foraging/scavenging instincts are finely honed, and we have him to thank for much of our furniture). each piece once belonged to someone who could afford to let it go.

there's a politics to this, obviously. the fact that some people's waste becomes other people's windfalls. the way entire economies emerge around the excesses of the wealthy. the artists and freelancers and service workers who make neighborhoods "vibrant" and "creative" while unable to afford the rents those same qualities drive upward.  the enrichment-opportunists, colonizing the remains of those who've moved on to something better.

but also scavenging is not a shameful thing. it's an important part of cycles. it's how nutrients circulate. it's how matter moves through systems.

i’ve been thinking about how i feel a desire to see a more robust anti consumer movement in our culture. i certainly risk being the snobby friend with my distaste for amazon orders, my refusal to ever order food delivery, to wear garments that aren’t thrifted or made for life. we've made such a moral disaster out of waste and consumption. as if needing things makes you weak. as if taking what others discard makes you desperate. as if the proper relationship to objects is to own them new, use them briefly, dispose of them cleanly. as if participating in the endless churn of production and consumption is somehow more dignified than picking through its remnants.

but what if we thought about it differently? what if decomposition was honorable?

in nature, the decomposers are essential. without them, the world would be buried in the corpses of everything that had ever lived. nutrients would stay locked in dead tissue. nothing new could grow. the bacteria, the fungi, the worms, the beetles — these unglamorous creatures doing the gross work of breaking things down — they're what makes life possible.

the whale fall sustains dozens of species for decades. the carcass isn't trash. it's treasure. it's infrastructure. it's the foundation of an entire community. and the organisms that feed on it aren't lesser for doing so. they're not pitiable scavengers eking out a sad existence on scraps. they're specialists, exquisitely adapted to their niche, thriving in an environment where others couldn't survive.

the bone eating snot flower doesn't apologize for what it is. it doesn't wish it could photosynthesize instead. it just extends its roots and does its work, dissolving bone in the darkness, hosting its bacterial symbionts, reproducing in its strange way. it participates in the cycle. it transforms death into life.

there can be something almost spiritual in decomposition, if you let yourself see it that way. the idea that objects have multiple lives. that they can be released and reclaimed. that their value isn't extinguished when their first owner decides they're done. that there are entire communities sustained by what others consider finished.

i am dreaming about human fall. having my body cast off in the deep ocean, to feed the grotesque creatures of the deep. i mean this literally and metaphorically. literally: i want my body, when i'm done with it, to be returned to a system. to feed something. to break down and become other things. the idea of being sealed in a box in the ground, preserved, kept separate — it feels like refusing to participate. like hoarding nutrients that could be cycling.

i've been looking into green burials. mushroom suits. human composting where it's legal. ways to ensure that this body, which has taken so much from the world, gives something back. i like the idea of my calcium feeding plants. my carbon becoming soil. my atoms dispersing and recombining into beetles and bacteria and tree roots.

but metaphorically, too. i'm dreaming about living a life that feeds other lives. not in a martyrish way, not in a self-sacrificing way. but in a cycling way. putting things into circulation rather than hoarding them. making things that others can use, transform, build upon. being part of networks of exchange and reciprocity. leaving things on the curb for the next scavenger.

the whale doesn't know it's going to become a fall. it's just living its whale life, and then it dies, and then it sinks, and then it feeds an ecosystem for half a century. there's no intention in it. just participation in the cycle of matter and energy that makes up this planet. here’s jack lohmann: “in the moments that follow the death of a whale, a world is born, and then the earth erases it. the hagfish come, the sharks, bacteria. we all feed on what we have been given, blindly searching for something in the dark. we find it. our peaks are life-defining and inconsequential.”

what worlds can be born from my excesses? what decomposition can i facilitate?

i want to be grotesque and gorgeous and good at what i do. i want to be the bone eating snot flower, extending my roots, dissolving what others have left behind, hosting my symbionts, blooming in the dark.
