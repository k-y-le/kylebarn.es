it seems that there&rsquo;s always an appetite for creativity discourse (a la creative independent) &mdash; conversations around what spurs creativity, experiments in inducing a creative state, skill sharing. it&rsquo;s frequently tied up with an anxiety around productivity, either implicitly or explicitly. dedicating your life to creative practice (whatever that means) entails figuring out a method by which creativity and productivity intertwine. you have to make a living, somehow.


in response to the anxiety that i feel undergirding creativity discourse (how am i going to make money? who do i sell to? how do i brand myself without abandoning my values?), i&rsquo;m curious about carving out a path to approaching my own thinking about (and intellectualizing) creativity that doesn&rsquo;t seek to invoke creativity. what i mean is that i&rsquo;m not often particularly compelled by practices which attempt to isolate and thereby replicate moments of creative expression. i&rsquo;m not interested in toolkits to become a more creative person. instead, i&rsquo;m looking towards ways to make space for living well, understanding &ldquo;living well&rdquo; as an inherently creative idea.


during the con/crit/tec residency in S&atilde;o Paulo, Orkan told me that he always tries to live like an artist. this is more than just being an artist; many artists don&rsquo;t live like an artist. we discussed for a while - what does this really mean? i find it telling that we were unable to come up with a particularly succinct definition of living like an artist. that&rsquo;s because i&rsquo;m beginning to wonder if this concept is one that evades definition. perhaps it&rsquo;s simply too slinky, too diffuse, too vibes-based to take well to language.


it makes me think about my precious life. more than the mary oliver reference, i think of my own life as precious in that i am consciously imbuing it with some value. i am trying to treat every day like it is a precious gift that i am fortunate enough to steward through the world. as someone with admittedly higher-than-average serotonin levels (i think this is how it works), at times this preciousness comes easily. but regardless of dispositions towards joy or depression, i have a suspicion that we would all treat our lives more preciously, if we were given the space and safety to do so. what i mean by this is that we have a tendency to feel embarrassed about being precious, being earnest. in pursuit of seeming cool we project an air of effortless ambivalence &mdash; our successes come to us out of some intrinsic personal talent, even as we toil after them. my precious life is one in which i am fiercely committed to things that bring me joy. particularly, the little things. my precious life is such because of my precious little objects. and as anyone who has seen my current apartment knows, there are many.

precious has other meanings, too. i&rsquo;ve always found that calling a work of art &ldquo;precious&rdquo; can be a scathing indictment. a precious work is one that is too enamored with itself, that carries a self-importance which overwrites histories and belies ego. but, actually, i want my art to be precious. i pour my self seriousness into my creativity because i want to. simple as that. it feels good to be precious, and who am i trying to impress, anyways? again, i&rsquo;m trying to approach creativity from where the rainfall of enforced productivity does not fall. but my shade is rickety; drops still get in.


((there&rsquo;s something here, too, on the value of punk and being callous and abrasive with my own life. but i&rsquo;m still gasping at the sunlight each morning; my life is no cold-hearted, untamed beast))


on a late morning the other day, i realized that i don&rsquo;t actually enjoy the taste of milk in my tea. i just love the way it looks as the milk diffuses into the beverage, spiraling and stirring. i could watch it for hours. i think living well is, in part, about doing things just for beauty. sometimes, doing things you don&rsquo;t want to do, out of desire to create a beautiful precious moment. my coworker remarked that i seemed really lost in my tea, as i reached sixty seconds of watching the milk diffuse. they make a joke about reading tea leaves, tell me that they think i would be a successful fortune teller. i tell them that i don&rsquo;t know anything about the future, just that right now, in this moment, i think the milk falling into the tea is the most gorgeous thing in the world. i want to fold up this moment and hold it close to my heart. i absorb it into my precious life.


my apartment is full of still lives. that&rsquo;s how i described it when i brought a date home a few weeks ago. i wasn&rsquo;t trying to be glib, though in hindsight i sound awfully pretentious. maybe that&rsquo;s part of my charm, or maybe my preciousness is grating. am i leaving space for the preciousness of others? or am i so enchanted by the milk in the tea that i forget to save some for anyone else? i assemble little moments in my life, and reassemble again and again, because of the delight that comes out of gazing at some combination of objects brought together in a novel way. i think my brain works this way, sometimes, in that i find myself in a corner of my mind palace where there are three ideas arranged in a beautiful pattern, and suddenly i am struck that it is my purpose to share this beauty with the world. i am tying knots in the image of interconnection. i am weaving precious concepts. i am running behind for my zoom meeting, and i have no excuse. i was busy weaving.

one of the things i love most about cats is when they are one moment lounging in a relaxed position, and the next moment manic, darting across the room after some unidentifiable stimulus. i love it so much because it reminds me that these creatures are unknowable to me; they live in a world i wouldn&rsquo;t recognize. i admire people who act this way too, though they aren&rsquo;t often the best collaborators. when someone is clearly at the whims of their compulsions, it can be endearingly precious. they burst with excitement as they identify a new project or follow a desire that bubbles up through their body. and it can also be unsettling, unreliable, uneasy. the cat, too, might be off chasing away some unseen threat. they may be the threat, themselves.


olivia and i were recently talking about daydreams. while my daydreams are often about alternative life paths, she described hers as more oriented towards impulses. a daydream of &ldquo;what if i let out a scream and sprinted down this street,&rdquo; &ldquo;what if i sat in the middle of this table right now.&rdquo; i wonder if living creatively is lingering with these daydreams. asking &ldquo;what if&rdquo; and answering it. feeling safe enough to follow the impulse. being discerning enough to know when not to. my coworker stops to ask me what i&rsquo;m listening to. she can hear it through my headphones, after i turned the volume way up to listen to my favorite part (song: donnie darko by let&rsquo;s eat grandma). in every moment i&rsquo;m doing some sort of calculation: how much louder do i make my music? do i get up and dance? is someone looking at my screen right now? i suspect that living creatively entails a wider latitude for these sorts of decisions than is afforded in the corporate office where i send emails and fill out airtable spreadsheets. but i also suspect that living creatively entails inviting others into this space of impulsiveness without alienating them. i might be the most impulsive person in my office, but does that make me the most creative? or do i just have a lower and more individual threshold for pursuing daydreams? i&rsquo;d like to see more creativity discourse that implores us to create spaces that invite others into our creativity, as a regular practice. i don&rsquo;t want &ldquo;creative time&rdquo; i want time, generally, in which my creativity bounces off of others and combines in new and unfamiliar forms.


part of living well is surrounding yourself with people who ask you these questions that prompt you to think differently about the world, or otherwise result in surprising answers. living well as growing together. i&rsquo;m trying to get better at being the question asker, too, though that doesn&rsquo;t always come naturally to me.


sometimes it feels like, as a privileged young professional in nyc, that every other time you meet someone new you end up in a conversation about what they like / don&rsquo;t like about new york. it can be kind of exhausting, but also good practice. at work on tuesday i was asked and ended up articulating a new response that i hadn&rsquo;t before: i love new york because it&rsquo;s where i&rsquo;ve found people who are deeply committed to this form of living well. i still believe that all people are creative and have creativity within them, but i no longer believe that this creativity takes the same form as that which ignites my own. the constructive interference i&rsquo;m looking for, wherein my own creative impulses combine with others and blossom, has felt closest to me when i&rsquo;m in community in new york, in some way combining art and beauty and movement and interpersonal connection and fascination and probably 100 other things that i&rsquo;ll never be able to name.


sometimes i think back to my &ldquo;i decorate my apartment as a series of still lives&rdquo; moments of pretension and recognize that my articulation of creatively living well must also include an element of levity. playfulness has to be a part of this living well, otherwise i think my life becomes soft and saccharine &mdash; an overripe persimmon. many dear friends make poop jokes all the time. i admire them deeply for how they approach life intentionally and tenderly. and for their poop jokes.

undergirding all this reflection on what living well really means is just plain gratitude. i&rsquo;m so, so grateful to be alive, and particularly to be living in relation to all the incredible people and creatures and beings and ecosystems in my life. i&rsquo;m genuinely inspired by my friends every single day, and take so much joy out of spending deep time with them, introducing them to each other. i&rsquo;ve shared <a href="https://mayakeren.bandcamp.com/album/blebba-grows?from=search&search_item_id=3037205020&search_item_type=b&search_match_part=?&search_page_id=3011796056&search_page_no=1&search_rank=1&search_sig=86b14b4957a4e33d2287c7b37bce817a">maya&rsquo;s music</a>&nbsp;with three different friends this week, because i&rsquo;m just overflowing with appreciation for the incredible art that they have shared with the world, and i want to share that with more people. living well is an ongoing practice of gratitude. creativity is a gift economy.


it can be tiring, at times, to return to the constant refrain that everything is connected, entangled even, in dynamic relation to one another. even as it trickles from feminist philosophy into more mainstream discourses, it can feel like an easy-out. but the more i write and think about and articulate my own values for living well, the more i realize that i simply have to retain a connection to this idea of entanglement. i&rsquo;m not trying to undo the knots that bind me to the world, but i am investigating them. one of the purest joys of life is uncovering new ways to live, new configurations of that which binds me to the inescapable experience of being a body in the world. Audre Lorde: <em>once we begin to feel deeply all the aspects of our lives, we begin to demand from ourselves and from our life-pursuits that they feel in accordance with that joy which we know ourselves to be capable of.</em>
