life full of wonders lately. the changing of the seasons makes for colors that stop me in my step, every day.  other recent simple joys: the ritual of brewing tea at home, watching the kids from the school across the street play during recess, pulling out sweaters for the first time in months, reaching a new milestone in climbing (first 11c today), biking over the bridge at sunset, watching a wasp crawl across my keyboard at a cafe, turning on my lamps as the sun sets, stepping out of a hot room into cool air, laying in the park at night, running into friend(s) who find an event through my newsletter. living can be delicious! some recent pictures, all from the past week:
