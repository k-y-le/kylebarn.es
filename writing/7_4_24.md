so many dragonflies at the cemetery today. they hover above the long grass, tracing meandering intersecting paths. seemingly undeterred by the wind, the ample predators about. it’s dragonfly season in green-wood.

i woke up this morning thinking about sound. i live on a noisy street, with construction on a large residential building well underway down the block, and an elementary school playground directly opposite my bedroom window. at the summer camp that has taken up residence as soon as the school year ended, they were playing recycled pop hits at 7:30am. this while the construction site down the street plays its own chorus of beeping, buzzing, hammering, and screeching. perhaps i sound spiteful, but  i appreciate the noise for what it is: alive. so, as i wander through the scenic paths of green-wood cemetery, i am making note of the sounds. the slight buzz of hovering dragonflies. the whine of lawnmowers scattered around the park. the drone of an airplane departing JFK, the blare of a police car streaking down 4th ave. wind sweeping through the trees, making symphonies out of leaves. i come here to think, and to be surrounded. by the sounds, by the dragonflies, by the souls of the dead.

life in new york city is about being surrounded. a practice, even, of surrounding oneself. all the time: sights, sounds, people, creativity, inequality. urban density means experiences fold onto each other, making daily palimpsests out of streets. it’s intoxicating, and it’s overwhelming.

i have a tree that i lay under, in green-wood. a planetree with long loping branches, sweeping close to the earth, as if drawn in by some spiritual connection to the graves under its protection. it always feels to me as if it’s beckoning me to linger in the dappled glow of its canopy, and i’m happy to oblige. if i’m still enough, the dragonflies come to visit.

i’ve just finished taking a call for work, some directionless conversation about AI climate policy, which i took from the cemetery out of a need to replace the cacophony of my block with one of a different genre. now i’m under my tree, which is not my tree (if it belongs to anyone, it belongs to the dead), thinking. i have all these grand expectations of my life, some brought about by the privilege of higher education and others from the deeply instilled craving for validation in the form of prestige. even in humbling myself, some echoes of the expectations remain, and i think it’s because of these trees, this meadow waving in the wind. this, even, is a grand ambition, that i should be able to lay here and ponder.

the world is full of magnificence, of grandiosity, if i allow myself to receive it. amy has [this gorgeous song](https://open.spotify.com/track/6KH1UE5OUDmjRqPYthLg1S?si=a88d33ee1ccb44bf) with the line “new york dead don’t rest cause they don’t give em enough space,” which was written about a different cemetery but may as well be this one, too. i’m wondering when you know that you’ve done enough, when there’s not enough space. when you just let yourself take all the grandiosity in. when you say farewell to ambition, lay under your favorite tree, watch the branches bristle and listen to the sounds surrounding you.
