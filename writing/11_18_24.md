this week, it’s creature of interdependence (not really but i wrote this like 3 weeks ago). from looking inward, to the creature that we understand ourselves to be, we look outward. well, not quite — we look inward too, but rather than asking how a creature feels or thinks, we’re asking how a creature is in relation to others. these others are inside us: the bacteria and viruses and parasites and beings tangled up in our mutual becoming. the others are also outside us, in the networks that we can trace spanning countries and continents. living as a creature of interdependence means paying particular intention to the ways in which we are connected. not through some abstract spiritual ocean, but in specific, traceable ways. eve tuck writes that everything is connected to everything else, but in the way that your specific something is connected to another specific something which is connected to another specific something. 

something powerful here. humbling. because so many of the structures of our lives are predicated on ignorance (sometimes willful, sometimes not) of how we are all connected. and because it is immense. in class we do a kin-mapping exercise, exploring what our circles of relations are. part of the purpose of the exercise is to experience just how quickly the expansiveness of our entanglement becomes overwhelming. we can, at no point, comprehend how truly vast we are. the only path forward is humility.

one of the readings for class is *[kawsak sacha](https://www.are.na/block/31715732)*, or living forest, a concrete proposal from the Sarayaku nation. *kawsak sacha* attempts to operationalize the humility of kinship. if we know and recognize that the forest is alive, that we are alive as part of it, that life moves through the forest in unpredictable and unexpected ways, then we must honor it as such. a subtle facet of this proposal is a reframing of conservation, away from the cooly objective claim of protection, itself rooted in observation from afar, the god-trick, an illusion that we are not entangled with the landscapes we seek to conserve. no, people live here. creatures live here. we move fluidly between and among these different ways of being.

from within the heart of urban empire, it can be easy to distance ourselves from our interdependence. but, as alexis shotwell reminds us, “even if we live in a city where the air does not make us sick, we are still implicated in the air, land, and water of contaminated places.” colonialism operates through dispossession and displacement. we see (or, rather, don’t see) displacement every single day: in the carting off of our trash to unknown facilities and barges headed to china, in the diffuse toxicity of air pollution that accumulates in the organs of sensitive creatures, in the apps which invisibilize the labor behind our food.

*all my guilt is being displaced to the great pacific garbage patch*

that’s part of why we assigned a reading for creature of interdependence about [salamanders evolving to adapt to toxicity](https://aeon.co/essays/in-the-age-of-humans-this-salamander-has-an-edge-over-us). amphibians have much to teach us about interdependence, living as they are with skin as a respiratory interface. beholding how salamanders are evolving to adapt to human-generated toxic chemicals prompts one to wonder about our own ongoing transformations — both individually, and collectively, across generations. becoming a creature of interdependence means coming to terms with this change, even when it is invisible, harmful, or confusing. here’s eva hayward: “Is there a way to re-evaluate ecological resilience—such as the sex-changing response—and meet the future organisms that we are becoming? ... We are all in chimeric borderlands where new forms of life are emerging.”

i want to welcome my future selves, my porous becoming, even as it may betray me. i know that i am impure, toxic, and only becoming more so. so it is, in this world of capital and chemical. rather than directly resist this, from an individual level, instead i’m seeking to chart a path of good relations with my interdependent future self — speculating on what creature i will be. in doing so, i become more attuned to the possibilities for flourishing, particularly with others, and more capable of being in good relationship with toxicity. i don’t mean this to sound like a fantasy; i’m not trying to “love my cancer” or something of the sort. instead, it’s more like an acceptance, an acknowledgement that the many ways in which my body will break down and dissolve in the future (including the final disintegration, whenever that may be) are inevitable, and can be welcomed. we all become disabled, eventually. this should come as no surprise.

i’ve been wondering why i don’t feel particularly bothered by the realization that i am not an individual. that i am made up of practically uncountable constituent parts. i guess in a way i’ve always held loosely to my sense of a bounded self, been receptive to otherness. it’s part of what drew me so deeply into the [southern reach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Reach_Series) books, some of my favorite sci-fi writing. while fears of the wrongly-evolved human underlie much of sci-fi’s past, from frankenstein to any zombie story, i love how vandermeer neither celebrates nor capitulates to the strange transformations that area x induces in its visitors. what i see in this kind of approach is a receptivity to awe that i can identify with. rapid evolution as something which resists moral judgements, instead focusing on the compelling visceral experience of change itself. in *anniliation,* the biologist knows this, as a student of the humble science. i’m no biologist, but i think i’m beginning to understand it, too.

we are all in chimeric borderlands. we are all transforming, even if we don’t understand how. we are all entangled within webs that spiral from the smallest microbes in our gut to the unfathomably massive sun that sustains us. these truths are not negotiable, even as they shift and shimmer. what is up to us, however, is what we do about it. in my mind, a creature of interdependence is someone who lives in loving attention to their coinhabitants. we are all collaborating here.
