there&rsquo;s a lot to say about raving, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/raving">Raving</a><strong><strong>,</strong></strong>&nbsp;McKenzie Wark&rsquo;s new book out on duke university press. dancing and dancing-adjacent forms of movement have been an important part of my life for a while now, but it wasn&rsquo;t until moving to brooklyn that i really embraced the rave. this comes with all sorts of connotations that i&rsquo;m sure many adults in my life would tsk tsk about, but i think it&rsquo;s worth treating raving with the levity it deserves as an outsider space, as a&nbsp;<em>surround</em>&nbsp;a la&nbsp;<a href="https://www.minorcompositions.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/undercommons-web.pdf">Harney &amp; Moten</a>. in late stage capitalism, in the anthropocene, we need spaces to, at the very least, treat seriously as an alternative. as a not-quite-utopia. reading Wark&rsquo;s new work has prompted a lot of thoughts on what raving offers to myself and to my community.


rave as utopia is nothing new. it&rsquo;s easy to point towards this practice, often explicitly radical and explicitly queer, as that which is creating the idealized future of liberation. but is that really the case? in&nbsp;<em>Raving</em><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;Wark deliberates makes note of the ways in which raves don&rsquo;t really mean utopia, whether it&rsquo;s their role in accelerating gentrification or their infiltration by policing or patriarchy. i have to agree &mdash; we&rsquo;re so desperate for spaces outside oppressive late capitalist normativity that the temptation exists to call the rave a utopia, but more often than not, a brooklyn (or berlin, or LA, or elsewhere) rave feels like a contested space. maybe it can approximate what&nbsp;<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/arena-attachments/778680/9f854c3b90c610a0097a354fa4142568.pdf">Jos&eacute; Esteban Mu&ntilde;oz</a>&nbsp;calls &ldquo;the warm illumination of a horizon imbued with potentiality,&rdquo; in which we are collectively&nbsp;<em>horizoning</em>&nbsp;utopia. or maybe we just want to dance to loud music and be left alone.


Wark&rsquo;s is one of many attempts to intellectualizing raving. or intellectualize nightlife generally. i&rsquo;m glad she and others make these attempts, but can&rsquo;t help but feel a suspicion towards the idea of fitting a practice generally outside intellectual space into the formal categories of conceptual thought. please don&rsquo;t turn the club into the university. Wark is clearly self-aware about this tendency and it&rsquo;s maybe-impossibility, often calling out her own tendency to self-critique while on the dance floor. still, if raving is about losing yourself, why would you try to find yourself again, conceptually? to me, the answer lies in how it illuminates other practices, other ways that we gather.


raving is often about transgression, of various forms. transgression of gender, of dress, of drug use, of sonic barriers and of rituals of normativity. it&rsquo;s these transgressions that would probably make my parents squirm, but most raves i go to in brooklyn are some of the safest feeling spaces i visit in new york. i would feel safer at the rave than at the chelsea gallery opening, where it feels as if every other person is shooting daggers with their gaze, looking not for art but for clout. but when the transgressions of nightlife (not just raving but of ballroom, drag shows, much else) exit the quarantined realm of bars and clubs, proudly parading into the light of day, it becomes a threat. to many, it&rsquo;s a threat to how they gather, to how they feel secure in their place in the world.

it feels most lucid right now in the right wing anti-trans panic (i believe strongly that calling it a panic, rather than movement or legislation, is important &mdash; it&rsquo;s a cowardly cultural moment; it has no basis), itself an outsize response by those in power to an unserious threat to the shaky foundations upon which their power rests. a drag queen story time is not just positioned as a threat because it implicates children as free-willed humans (rather than as the feeble projection of the anxieties of power in its attempt to make children the sexless reproduction of neoliberal subjectivity), but also because it makes clear the precarious position of gender. gender, as i see it, also serving as a stand-in for the general fear wrought by displacement of whiteness and masculinity from the nexus of power.


raya and i have talked about this a lot recently, in particular in conversation with our ongoing practice of hosting experimental gatherings. one of the most joyous parts of hosting as tomorrow soup is creating and imagining these alternative spaces for experimenting with ones relations to self, to others, and to the environment. it&rsquo;s our belief that creating these spaces can be a radical act, can make the space for us to horizon utopia outside the limited structures available to us (the political rally, the drag show, the rave). so it follows that thinking about and through raving means thinking about and through how the maybe-queer-horizon of a rave holds lessons and warnings for generating a practice that discards normativity. not that tomorrow soup is going to set off a nationwide panic, but that holding space outside typical arrangements of power, for all its liberatory potential, invites danger or challenges from those unwilling to let go of their attachment to social forces like gender.


this is difficult, though, because (as Wark notes) so much labor goes into creating the outside space of the rave. it&rsquo;s nightlife workers, lighting people, djs, bouncers, promoters, so much more. but it&rsquo;s also us &mdash; the rave is co-created. all the right ingredients still makes for a bad rave if the ravers can&rsquo;t feel safe, can&rsquo;t have fun. so, too, is the experimental gathering a la tomorrow soup co-created, and reliant upon a certain willingness to transgress normativity from its participants. it presents a challenge; sometimes, old classmates ask me when the next soup time is, and i struggle to convey that this soup is not really for them. it&rsquo;s an unfortunate truth that a gathering can only take so many young professional cis tech workers before it becomes inconvertibly lame. (won&rsquo;t get into it here, but this is also a problem i have with &ldquo;raves&rdquo; as EDM festivals, which feel to me like a commodified form of alt-normativity. i want better for yall!).


in&nbsp;<em>Raving</em><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;Wark creates personas to help us think through this. there&rsquo;s the&nbsp;<em>punisher<strong>,</strong></em>&nbsp;&ldquo;someone who makes it hard to get your rave on,&rdquo; usually by being on their phone or having a conversation on the dance floor or being creepy. then there&rsquo;s the&nbsp;<em>coworker</em><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;people who just want a night out so they have something to talk about at work on monday.&rdquo; they&rsquo;re inevitable at most raves, the people who don&rsquo;t understand the rave as a collaboration, who come with assumptions and bring those into the space, disrupting the flow. there are usually some co-workers at a tomorrow soup event (it&rsquo;s important to show them that they can let go, too!) but a punisher will tank the vibe. it&rsquo;s not our job (nor the job of the dj, the promoter, or the nightlife workers) to show the punisher the err of their ways. at the rave, i usually move on and find a different spot to lose myself to the music.


but nightlife, in brooklyn at least, still needs these people, who tend to spend more money on drinks and cover than the regular ravers. it&rsquo;s the reality of surviving in one of the most expensive cities in the world. it&rsquo;s just like how i need my day job (in some ways, i&rsquo;m a coworker, though hopefully one that contributes to, rather than disrupts, the flow) in order to afford tickets and therefore let loose. Wark describes herself as a bit of a coworker too, but in doing so recognizes that there&rsquo;s a need here: &ldquo;besides freeing me from gender dysphoria, raves also free me from alienated labor &mdash; or appear to. techno pounds the living shit out of my brain, freeing it from nagging worries about emails unsent. the psychic damage of certain types of cognitive and affective labor can be temporarily healed on the dancefloor.&rdquo;


i strongly relate to this, to the rave as a necessary place to let go of my alienated subjectivity (different&nbsp;<a href="https://cidadeinseguranca.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/deleuze_control.pdf">dividual</a>), and to release the &ldquo;ten pounds of pressure&rdquo; from living in &ldquo;this killing machine called america.&rdquo; (is it too dramatic&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/T47ijn0aHzg">to quote Wojnarowicz</a>&nbsp;here? not sure.. but ever since i saw this video i&rsquo;ve thought about the pressure every single week). this <em>does</em>&nbsp;</span>make it&nbsp;feel like horizoning utopia, like getting free, even if it&rsquo;s just a placebo or just the euphoria of a moment when the beat hits just right.


these moments make me want to give myself over to the release. this is impossible; this is nowhere to be found. it makes me want to stop straddling the lines between scenes and worlds and just lean in. should i be the rave regular? should i be the radical organizer? should i be the tender musician? should i be the art world wannabe? i keep trying to be all these things, and more. i still can&rsquo;t give them up (and why should i?). should i get a neck tattoo? they&rsquo;re so common here in s&atilde;o paulo, and everyone looks so cool.


i think this internal conflict (who am i going to be? i can and want to be anybody and everybody) is something i have to sit with. i can&rsquo;t and shouldn&rsquo;t wish it away. part of it is borne out of my privilege, of my white male-presenting body that mostly exempts me from being boxed in by the assumptions of society that constrain my Black and trans community. i&rsquo;m especially grateful to those who make raving possible, who make space for someone like me who shapeshifts between personas (embracing the dividual) and likes it that way. i owe a lot to those who came before me,&nbsp;<a href="https://primaryinformation.org/product/assembling-a-black-counter-culture/">the Black and trans progenitors of house and techno</a>. i benefit, in my own way, off their struggle for liberation, even as that liberation continues to only exist on the utopian horizon. but i know that our getting free is never zero-sum. we&rsquo;re in this together, aren&rsquo;t we? we have to be in this together.


am i over-intellectualizing my life? or is the intellectual/conceptual how i make sense of my position in the world, my feelings? recent conversations and conflicts have made me question the authenticity of my experience, my ability to make about and around certain emotions. one of the reasons i write is to make sense of my life and of the world. because i feel a frustration with how i can&rsquo;t point to an emotion or raw experience to explain who i am and why. there&rsquo;s no pointing here. there&rsquo;s only me, eyes closed against the sway of bodies as the beat pulses through me.
