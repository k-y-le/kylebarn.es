early days of 2024. i&rsquo;m thinking about what the past year has been, and who i became. experiencing the new year as a little ritual that we construct for ourselves. one of many rituals, really. lately i&rsquo;ve been wondering what would happen if i labeled everything a ritual. me who spends so much time seeking out ritual, figuring out ritual, contemplating ritual, creating ritual. it&rsquo;s all ritual, after all, maybe, perhaps. or maybe this word should be retired.&nbsp;like cheugy, and bromance.


i find it difficult to apprehend a year. as a marker of time it feels both too short and too long for me to think with. i am not a years-long being. i am in this moment, this now. and i am in the long expanse in which i see myself and all the ideas and beings that i touch, extending into the deep past and deep future along epochal timescales. this is no new year&rsquo;s resolution.


where has the year began and ended? quite literally, going upside down on raya&rsquo;s couch in los angeles. going upside down on isla&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; stairs in bloomington. i wonder how i would recognize myself from one year ago, now. slightly different haircut, a couple new tattoos, a breadth of diffuse newness about me. intangibly changed. forever changed. altogether, a different person. altogether, the same. i&rsquo;m following the structure of modern life as we collectively accept it. it feels like a form of giving in. losing control. the clock destroys me, and i destroy it.


in 2020, my new year&rsquo;s resolution was to destroy the concept of time. perhaps i do this every single day, when i try and fail to wrap my head around its interminable march. forwards, we say, time goes forwards. and no radical quantum futurism or speculative thought experiment is going to convince me otherwise. i have been marinating in modernity. i can feel it seeping through my flesh. giordano nanni: &ldquo;European territorial expansion has always been closely linked to, and frequently propelled by, the geographic extension of its clocks and calendars.&rdquo; i am the manifestation of european territorial expansion. and i am propelled by the extension of the clock and the calendar.


time is usually about flow. it flows, i flow. but there&rsquo;s friction in being one who approaches time differently. who refuses the month, the year. i embrace the ritual of a new year because i don&rsquo;t seek out this friction; i have other abrasivenesses. why bother? living intentionally requires work. effort. there are all these concepts for how we can use time, spend our time wisely, avoid wasting time, etc. speculations on what life could be, with a different mechanism beside it. an anti-realist approach, sure to abhor my scientist colleagues. it&rsquo;s brave to test the waters of otherness. it is also lazy. is it real time, queer time, linear time, free time, thick time? does it fold, does it stretch? it&rsquo;s fun to be creative with time, and i play with it now even as i blithely accept the ongoingness of our present moment.

i don&rsquo;t want to wade into intellectual nothingness. i haven&rsquo;t said anything important, yet. we get lost in conceptual labyrinths where time becomes some tentacular, quantum thing, when all along the trouble was hanging out in the &ldquo;when.&rdquo; language fails to escape, and i don&rsquo;t either.


i am a creature &mdash; that&rsquo;s my main resolution for the year. be a creature. be creaturely. why? i&rsquo;ve been feeling some frustration with intentionality, with ritual. i suppose i&rsquo;m feeling frustration about intellectual musings on time, too. a creature doesn&rsquo;t bother. i&rsquo;m frustrated with all these things i proclaim a commitment to. with trying to change myself to be more palatable, amenable, relatable. i am a creature and i will make weird noises. roll in the dirt. gaze, for a while, at a weed.


new years is a time for intentions, for dreaming. for imagining who i am and want to be. but i&rsquo;m stuck on lauren berlant&rsquo;s idea of cruel optimism, wherein that which you desire is actually an obstacle to your flourishing. on the retreat in bloomington isla&rsquo;s parents share that for new years they compiled a list of cognitive dissonances. we eat cheese even though we know it&rsquo;s torture. we drive a gas truck even though we know it&rsquo;s apocalypse. i&rsquo;m circling around intentionality, again, as always, as usual. lauren berlant, again: &ldquo;Love is always about violating your own attachment to your intentionality, without being anti-intentional. I like that love is greedy. You want incommensurate things and you want them now. And the now part is important.&rdquo;


i like that love is greedy. i&rsquo;m greedy, too. or at least i feel that way, when i continue to act the way i have always done so and simultaneously disappoint and delight in the process. i&rsquo;m greedy for a stage where i am celebrated for who i am. i am greedy for a cruel optimism without the cruelty. i am having fantasies of an unfettered desire.


what is incommensurate about my life? or, put otherwise, what are my cruel optimisms? there are many; i know this to be true. what does incommensurate even mean? google says: <em>out of keeping or proportion with.</em> add &ldquo;using google when i know it&rsquo;s a data-hungry monopoly&rdquo; to the list of dissonances. i have a sneaking suspicion that my conception of self is incommensurate with my realization of self. i have a sneaking suspicion that this is true of all of us, and only a few are clairvoyant enough to see it. that&rsquo;s what buddhism was all about, anyways, and where did it get us? i can buy a mandala tapestry for twenty four dollars and ninety nine cents.


delivered to my door, too. it&rsquo;s all delivery these days. except that which we have to go out and get, and i mean really go out and get it. but what can&rsquo;t we have brought to our doorstep these days? apps promise me love and invisible servitude. a ride to the club and a warm meal without a soul in sight. except perhaps the soul who packed it, or the soul who will poke through the remains of said packaging when it makes its way to the landfill. but maybe it will get lost in the refuse. maybe i will, too. amongst our some unending discard, it&rsquo;s easy to forget. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_of_death_(Italy)">triangle of death</a> grows and absorbs me. i nestle in among its acute angles.

michel de certeau: &ldquo;an absence of meaning opens a gap in time&rdquo; &mdash; but there&rsquo;s no gap here. the now is the now, and my incommensurate body wants an incommensurate body to match. i&rsquo;m thinking about expiration dates. the conscious ending of time. linearity, regularity stretches into expiration borderlands. i throw out some old sour cream. cognitive dissonance, check.


i like to think of the space in between the years as a gap in time. before, during, after :: past, present, future. novelty also opens gaps in time, though i&rsquo;m beginning to think time may be more of a net than a blanket, anyways, how else do you explain the black holes? i don&rsquo;t explain them, actually, though i did recently watch interstellar. endlessly pursuing novelty is one way of expanding the length of one&rsquo;s life. or at least, according to the brain, which recalls memories more clearly when attached to a new setting, a new situation. a new vibe, if you will, and i will, since i&rsquo;m always cultivating one. in high school, i used to get told that i was &ldquo;such a vibe&rdquo; and &ldquo;so aesthetic.&rdquo; i used to embrace it, softly smile, nod along. i don&rsquo;t mean that i was popular, just that i gave off an air of difference, of novelty. the life in my brain longer than others. but i&rsquo;m drawn to continuity, as i write from the desk in my bedroom that has remained my bedroom for eight out of the nine months of my lease, thus far.


i think i&rsquo;m going to renew. i think i&rsquo;ll stay here, maybe absorb myself into the brick wall, maybe complain to management about our broken stove lighter. or maybe i&rsquo;ll just get over it, sit here and watch as time passes. everything is according to the brain, novelty or otherwise. the passing of a year has been so deeply ingrained in me that i would frankly struggle to comprehend if it ceased to be. a life without time: unimaginable, but maybe possible, by which i&rsquo;m really thinking about a life without language. fernando pessoa: &ldquo;The day after tomorrow doesn&rsquo;t exist. This is what exists: A blue sky&rdquo;


i&rsquo;m renewing, now. taking this marker of a new time, a new living, and rolling it around in my mouth. i imagine it a pearl, like in that one mitski song, gleaming and growing. time passes inside my mouth, which is itself a universe, home to bacteria and viruses alike. one universe melts into another, one deleuzian dividual disassembles and reassembles, and maybe it was all quantum after all, though karen barad would take issue with my carelessly waving around theoretical physics. these are all labyrinths. time, too, though i actually don&rsquo;t believe that. i&rsquo;m not sure i believe anything i&rsquo;ve just written, just that i&rsquo;m full of dissonances, and full of tentacular time, and that we should definitely retire the word bromance.

in 2024, i want to ____. so goes a list i stumble upon in my journal, written in mid october from a seat at a dirty cafe in the university neighborhood of bologna. i add the date to contextualize; time always requires context. so greedy, time is, asking for this and that to be understood. i like that time is greedy. but still i want to isolate it, strip it down, look it in the eyes and tell it that i know. i know what it is and has been and will be, and i know the future too. but that&rsquo;s not what creatures do, and though i didn&rsquo;t write it in that cafe, my creatureliness has enveloped my 2024 ambitions. dreams wait and sometimes wither, and i continue to sniff the air, run my hand along the wall, dart my eyes back and forth. time layers and folds and stretches and solidifies and i sit here witnessing it all with no intention, no ritual, no resolution. incommensurate indeed.
