two weeks ago i become an uncle. he was early, my nephew, but the landing was delayed — a few days of texts at odd hours repeating the same assurances that he would be coming soon, things were looking good. i’ve been marveling at how birth doesn’t tend to follow neat structures, as much as capitalism would like it to. babies are early; babies are late.

honestly, i felt more fear than excitement in the lead up. childbirth is such a dangerous thing. i feared for my sister’s well being, the baby’s well being. i feared that something might happen which is unexpected, i’d get a text, my heart would break.

we throw ourselves around in this life. that’s the only way to live, i think. we’re socially constituted, composed by our attachments. we expose ourselves, we make others, we come to know danger. 

here’s samantha hunt: “My body’s coursing with secret genes and hormones and proteins. My body made eyeballs and I have no idea how.” it seems to me that the miracle of childbirth is a miracle that any of this can even happen in the first place. after the child is born, the most intriguing part has ended. and miracles, anyways, have been too colonized by christianity and its placid grandeur. miracles don’t come fleeced in soft furs; they arrive bloody, beaten, of mud and earth.

ever since i read *the argonauts,* i wanted to get pregnant (this is serious and also a joke). the way maggie nelson talks about her changing body is so compelling. the fundamental weirdness of pregnancy seems a reminder that it is one of the ultimate body modifications. nelson: “Is there something inherently queer about pregnancy itself, insofar as it profoundly alters one's "normal" state, and occasions a radical intimacy with and radical alienation from one's body? How can an experience so profoundly strange and wild and transformative also symbolize or enact the ultimate conformity?”

the thought of telling my sister, with her husband, her dog, her girlies group chat called bachelor-nation that she’s queering the body through pregnancy makes me laugh. i associate her perhaps most primely with normativity. she has always been the paragon of the american dream to me: a husband, a corporate job, family values, taking the last name, a fantastical wedding, and now becoming a mother. by no means has her life been seamless, but it has been successful.

it makes me think about what i tend to call the fantasy of total queerness. it’s this idea that our existing tethers to normativity threaten our authority over queer experience. that stepping outside the alternative — whether through monogamy, marriage, child-rearing, employment, gender, art, or otherwise — constitutes a betrayal. we slide around in the race to be most radical.

in *the cyborg manifesto,* donna haraway writes that “This essay is an argument for *pleasure* in the confusion of boundaries and for *responsibility* in their construction.” i like this.

here i am, in this queer body that will never get pregnant. sometimes reifying gender, sometimes subverting it. always partial, always not-enough. not enough queer, not enough nonbinary, not enough conformity, not enough individuality, not radical enough. 

we throw ourselves around in this life. and isn’t that special? isn’t that everything? i am a careful creature. i float; i evade. i find myself foiled, fallen. i get back up again.

i’m curious about how one navigates the world in a male-presenting body. six foot three body, deep voice body, covered in hair body. today i’m made someone new — an uncle — by the deeply weird transformation of my sister’s body. new attachment unlocked.

this is, in some way, fundamental to the male experience. transformed by others’ transformations — constituted by proxy. we tend to be socialized as stability, rigidity. in high school, a friend liked to refer to me as “stable-bae.”

i am, like all of us, shaped by my encounters with motherhood, from birth to present day, to death. here’s judith butler: “To assume responsibility for a future is not to know its direction fully in advance, since the future, especially the future with and for others, requires a certain openness and unknowingness; it implies becoming part of a process the outcome of which no one subject can surely predict." a certain openness and unknowingness — ongoingness, too, i might add. surely childbirth is one of the ultimate ways to come upon this unknowingness. this uncertainty, this risk, this reward. 

perhaps is these encounters with unknowingness — the unavoidable ones which cannot be erased by pacifying technology or feel-good assurances of certainty — which allow us to deconstruct the rigid futurity of masculinity. it’s this futurity which i am trying to get free from (aren’t we all?). and maybe it’s silly of me to theorize motherhood from my brooklyn apartment while five miles away my sister lives it. aren’t i partaking in the age-old tradition of men speculating on women’s bodies? probably, but either way, i’m an uncle today.
