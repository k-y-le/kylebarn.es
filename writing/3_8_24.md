tinyletter is dead. gone the way of countless other actually useful products that were killed for their inability to generate absurd profit margins, now i’m left to make my own way. this is my new format, just a regular old email, sent from my inbox to yours. i’ve also created a website as an archive of previous newsletters, which i’ll link each time i send a new letter. the site itself is mostly functional, but very much still a work in progress, so please go easy on it (especially on mobile ☻)

i’m hoping to use this as an opportunity to be more creative with the ways i communicate, to display information in new forms, to try out poetic formatting structures. i want to be more forthcoming with thoughts, ideas, poetic phrases. sometimes in short bursts, sometimes in long drawn out essays. mostly, i just want this to continue to be a method by which i communicate some part of my inner self. in doing so, i’m seeking to open this newsletter up to people who are more peripheral in my life, to share it more freely and less self-consciously. to invite others to understand me through this format, the way that i used to invite others to get to know me through my instagram.

another tool lost to the profit loss statements of tech companies, another website i create myself. many of the best and most inspiring things come as a result of people charting their own way. refusing the well-trodden path of mass-market products makes life more difficult, but also makes available a wider variety of potential methods of expression. i keep having conversations with like-minded friends about the importance of creating spaces for these methods of expression. i keep searching for them myself.

it’s been a little over a year since i started writing in this newsletter. i have and continue to see it as an experiment in expression, in creativity. although i’m often using this as a space to wonder aloud about how to navigate complex systems of interlocking oppression and liberation, which is not exactly the first thing that comes to mind associated with the word “creativity,” i still see this as a creative practice. in particular, i believe that creativity, for me, involves a necessary entanglement in the importance of being in the world. in staying with the trouble, if you will. 

an emerging theme of my life lately has been preciousness. rather, the absence of it. i don’t want to be too precious about the things i create. i don’t want to find myself caught in spirals of anxiety over the relevance or applicability of a project. i don’t want to be precious. i just want to make things. i plan to be less precious with this newsletter, too, moving forward. which means that i’ll be sending out more emails, and that some will be short and annoying and experimental and reveal some of the stranger and less palatable parts of myself. but that’s me, too, and besides, you don’t have to read what i send.
