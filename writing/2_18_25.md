while over for dinner the other night, maya introduced that they had been tracking their daily mood. not for optimization, but more as a way of better understanding oneself. it makes me wonder whether i’m stable or wildly fluctuating. on the friday when we talk about it, i’d say i’m at a solid 6/7, but the next day a 2/3, then back to a 7 on sunday. this has been a week of wild swings, as i encounter and metabolize some profound shifts in my daily life. i used to consider myself indefatigably stable, at times to a fault. i was the rock for others to lean on; my friend claire in high school referred to me as her “stable bae”. but an issue with being the stable friend is that when things start to slip and wobble, it can feel like you are letting down others by shirking your responsibility. 

recently soy led a small group in a ritual, drawn from [burning the old year](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48597/burning-the-old-year), by naomi shihab nye. we honored and let go of attachments from the old year, while putting to paper our visions for the new year. thank you, soy, for offering the space — and the delicious tteokguk. as it turns out, it’s my fourth new year ritual of 2025, and probably not the last, as the definition of new year can vary widely depending on how you tell time. i like this, not least because it offers that renewal doesn’t happen all at once; you don’t just set your mind to a change and move on. instead, we return, we trace the same lines over and over again. as the earth turns, so do we.

*we call this one a mindful slay*

in thinking about what we’re letting go of and inviting in as we shift into a new year, i like approaching the questions from a relational angle. what relations do i want to deepen this year? which ones am i letting go of? i am not a machine to be improved. i will never be a quantified self. i’m a relational being, always in flux, always interdependent. not so stable, perhaps.

my word of the year is *sprout*, because i’m trying to decide which seeds to nurture and let grow, which to let run wild, and which to let go. i’ve been seeding my way into a life here in brooklyn, letting things take root, and i think this will be the year in which those seeds sprout and maybe even bloom. this new year, here are some intentions that i hope to carry with me, some relations to deepen, some sprouts in my life, directly from my new year intentions list during soy’s ritual:

- embracing my own weird impulses
- regularly move and stretch into life
- say what i need and want, when i feel it (even to myself!)
- nourish myself with healthy meals
- have more tea with friends
- tell stories, really work on storytelling
- embrace awe, desire, and delight
- channel my own anger
- just do the thing!
- attend to my body more deeply
- host more cool parties
- more dancing. more beauty. more beautiful dancing.
- go to the beach and the zoo and the garden and do it all
- build relationships with community spaces
- more exploratory drug experiences
- cry cry cry
- lay on the floor and listen to music
- composting
- get stronger

i’ve been listening to [steamboat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8xWf3ruodU) by adrianne lenker on repeat lately. there’s something i recognize in these lines: “one day imma be a steamboat baby / one day i can be a freight train lady / i’ll roll down the river and the miles won’t phase me.” in seeking to change and grow, i find myself hoping to let the differences shed from me in a painless action; when others see me as the steamboat, i begin to believe it so. i won’t share what of the old year i am letting go of (i burned it for a reason), but i do maintain a curiosity for the ways that i’ll carry traces of past relations while i shift into some new forms. do the miles phase me? where is this river headed, anyways?
