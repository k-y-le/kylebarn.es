i’m so attached to my devices. i feel this acutely, particularly when it gets cold and my phone battery starts failing to make it past a couple hours. in my (perhaps futile) efforts to resist the planned obsolescence of apple by getting a new phone, i experience more friction than our devices are designed to provide. in doing so, i continually am evaluating my relationship to technology, something which i’m trying to take as an opportunity rather than an inconvenience. a [generous friction](https://www.are.na/kyle-barnes/generous-frictions), like a surprising rainfall or when i’m in dumbo and the trains over the manhattan bridge interrupt my conversation. 

this week in class [or, the week in which i wrote this] was creature of technology. we were interested in examining how we might ourselves have a more creaturely relationship with technology, and how other creatures use and experience technology. in doing so, we wanted to trouble the nature/machine dichotomy, supplanting it with something more feral. we often think about technology as purely or primarily the sleek, the computational, the personal device, but thinking more expansively about what technology can be means relating to so much more of the world *as* technology. nonhumans use technology, invent technology, too — all the time. 

perhaps it’s surprising to teach a class on embodied creature practices and focus one entire day on technology. but i see it as a move towards creatureliness, rather than away. because technology is the fact of our existence; i owe my life to technology, in countless ways. the idea of a natural creaturely self, outside connection with technology, is surely a fallacy of purity. so is the idea that technology is a purely human domain — i’m interested in invoking a humility counter to the narratives of human exceptionalism that inform the sleek sophisticated aesthetics of consumer electronics. we can and should look to other forms that technology takes: ancestral technology, spiritual technology, infrastructural technology, and, of course, creature technology. 

i follow xenofeminist collective laboria cuboniks when she [claims](https://laboriacuboniks.net/manifesto/xenofeminism-a-politics-for-alienation/) that “the real emancipatory potential of technology remains unrealized.” and when she asserts that said emancipatory potential is not found in naturalism or essentialism. but in order to find said potential, we have to know our technology. we have to know our devices.

*one feature of having a failing device is its difficulty taking clear pictures. but, somehow it feels more real to have this low quality depiction of our phones altar. the phone is perceiving the phones.*

in class, i lead us in an exercise of mapping what an iphone is — what makes up its parts? where are the materials gathered? who assembles it? designs it? very quickly, we’re in over our head — mapping the life of a device like the iphone entails grappling with extraction and production forces extending to the far reaches of the globe. but i want to map what comprises my device in order to better relate to it. in one of our readings for class, [*making kin with the machines](https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/lewis-arista-pechawis-kite/release/1),* co-author suzanne kite writes about forming a relationship to AI as a form of relationship to stones, “as AI is formed from not only code, but from materials of the earth. to remove the concept of AI from its materiality is to sever this connection.” but what stones? what mines? all of our technology is material, even the cloud, and so our relationship to it should be a relationship to the earth from which it emerges. 

it seems foolish, to me, that we imagine ourselves not made of technology. even before birth, we are immersed in the technology of food science, brought forth into the world via machinic apparatuses, and dependent upon technology to meet our needs practically from cradle to grave. celebrating this interconnection (as we examined in our previous class, creature of interdependence), enables us to better see ourselves and others. it’s political, too, because my own demand for access to a better relationship with my technology brings me, first, to demand more access to transparency about where my tech comes from, and critically to demand a more ethical relationship to the thing. 

this is not just a serious political angle to modernity, but also fundamental to how we experience the world ourselves. in another reading for class, [magic in the machine](https://emergencemagazine.org/essay/magic-and-the-machine/), david abram argues that for many in contemporary life, machines have supplanted a form of relationship to nature. i think of this in terms of dependency — i depend upon my weather app to tell me if its going to rain, rather than developing my own sensibility for reading the sky and smelling the air (surely less effective, but also surely more gratifying as i begin to understand more firsthand how the world operates). this also runs counter to the generous friction of being caught out in an unexpected rainstorm — to glance at my device limits the spontaneous (and inconvenient!) moments of attention a rainstorm brings.

it can be otherwise. not through the negation, but through transformation. in class olivia leads us through an exercise of drawing the perceptive self, as augmented by technology, in the style of the [cortical homunculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_homunculus). in doing so, we understand more of how technology enables us to perceive the world more deeply, to bring us more in touch with the magic of life. interestingly, my drawing ends up as a kind of landscape, an island upon a primordial ocean. no wonder i have been drawn to have a chimeric relationship to meadows.

in doing so, we uncover ourselves as cyborgs. here donna haraway is, as always, a [touchstone](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fictionnownarrativemediaandtheoryinthe21stcentury/manifestly_haraway_----_a_cyborg_manifesto_science_technology_and_socialist-feminism_in_the_....pdf): “a cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction.” it’s creature all the way, here. creature in more than just body. we read a scientific paper about oyster mushroom-controlled robots, and they come alive in their social fictions, not just their science fact. 

we end our class with a brief ritual, drawn from a previous work i did with raya as tomorrow soup, in which we earnestly treat our cell phones as ritual objects. closeness can facilitate a richer relationship with our things — an ethics that nourishes us. cleansing our phones, so wrought as they are with the projections we make upon them (and they upon us), means clearing that which is obstructed, paving the way for a more healthy relationship with technology. thus, ritual is a tool for becoming a creature of technology, a being which is a sort of trickster, creatively maneuvering past the designed form, and the ways in which said designed form corrals us into certain ways of being. 

this is part of it, a rejection of the designed. everyone in brooklyn wants to be a designer, it sometimes feels like. but i’m less interested in choreography, and more in emergence. partially, this is the device as portal — not to the internet, but to the self. the screen is a mirror. what do we see when we peer at it and see it looking back at us? ritual offers a method by which we practice different ways of relating to our devices, exploring the space of possibility for our relationship to technology. that’s just the start, and soon i’m seeing (and treating differently) all the technologies that rule my life. my laptop and phone, yes, but also my air conditioning, the subway car, my kitchen utensils, internet infrastructure, brussels sprouts. pretty quickly, i find myself surrounded by magical objects, full of complex stories that i am only just beginning to glimpse. suddenly a world that may have felt so inert and sterile is ballooning with life, bursting at the seams. what a wonderful relationship to have. what a creaturely way of being.
