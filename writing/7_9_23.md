there&rsquo;s this dog on instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/bichon_mochimochi/" >@bichon_mochimochi</a>) that gives me the same feeling as when i look at kim kardashian.


i think it&rsquo;s something to do with perfection, something that looks too much like it was manufactured. like we&rsquo;re doing reverse uncanny valley. i don&rsquo;t really imagine this type of hyper-manicured dog in motion much, just like i can&rsquo;t really imagine kim kardashian doing manual labor. in my mind, she&rsquo;s static, like a cardboard cutout. she is what i see, and i&rsquo;m not meant to look any deeper. this is pleasurable, not only because she (like the dogs) has been sculpted to match our socialized understanding of sexy or cute, but also because it&rsquo;s nice not to be asked to do more thinking.


it&rsquo;s not something i share lightly but around once a month i spend 15-30 minutes scrolling through kim kardashian&rsquo;s instagram feed. sometimes i do kylie. i&rsquo;ve often been met with derision when i mention this and honestly i myself have been trying to figure out why exactly i have this compulsion. but i do believe that a big part of it is the experience of not having to think. i can check out of the world and forget about my problems while scrolling through perfection, each picture as shocking and completely expected as before. a marvel of mindlessness.

<h6 style="text-align: center;">when i look at these images i feel everything and nothing at the same time</h6>

so maybe i&rsquo;m attracted to looking at&nbsp;this dog for the same reason &mdash; it feels so perfect that i can&rsquo;t really look away. and like kim kardashian it feels as though the dog has come so asymptotically close to a society ideal of cuteness (or sexiness for kim k) that it becomes uncanny to look at. it makes all this hubbub about the existential threat of AI seem really funny to me. like, oh no! the AI is becoming more human!! literally, the human is becoming more AI. it seems emblematic of this unresolvable tension within culture these days. you are supposed to stand out (be different) but capitulate to the algorithm and the algorithmic whims of the general populace to be average (blend in). stick out, but in the right ways. become uniquely predictable. this maybe applies less to kim k and this uncanny dog, who have the branding and audience to set standards that others follow. this move becomes more eerie when it comes to the more downstream: instagram influencers, tik-tokkers, recent grad young professionals, you, me. we&rsquo;re all influenced by the diffusion of culture, of course, and always have been, but the algorithmic element adds a new factor to the way cultural production is organized. and bichon_mochimochi is absolutely attuned to what the algorithm will surface. paranoid fantasies of evil supercharged AI feel like slapstick horror jokes in how they lack any nuanced understanding of the ways that our agency is threatened by algorithmic recommenders and feeds. the success of tiktok has percolated into other platforms who continue to push algorithmic feeds, sometimes removing the option to opt-out.


it&rsquo;s also interesting to me how generally social media platforms are, anecdotally, getting worse. instagram hardly shows you pictures of your friends anymore. twitter seems like a trash fire generally. in service of advertising revenue we get more and more uncanny influencer types shown to us, often unwillingly or at least unknowingly. and to influence, too, is to be in service to the algorithm, which at times takes a more mystical hue as the all powerful organizer of information for our time.


i think that the suspended agency we feel at losing the ability to even control what we see when we use social media apps has a direct relation to the surfacing of a perfectly manicured dog on instagram. sianne ngai&nbsp;<a class="notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="1" href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674088122" rel="noopener noreferrer" tabindex="0"> writes about minor feelings</a>&nbsp;&mdash; that which signals a sort of suspended agency. they&rsquo;re minor because they&rsquo;re not cathartic, they don&rsquo;t get anything out. in this frame, the cultural moment of cute algorithmically surfaced (and soon to be algorithmically generated, i&rsquo;m sure) dogs runs parallel to how the malaise of living in the 21st century fuels our reliance upon minor feelings (cute, zany, interesting, for ngai). ngai argues that we increasingly deem things in life cute as a kind of trivial aesthetic category, unable to complete a feeling in the way that something being sublime or beautiful can (though i would say that beautiful, too, has gone the way of the postmodern ineffectual). cuteness, as a form of aestheticized powerlessness and a commodity aesthetic, thus signifies unfulfilledness &mdash; just like how we are unfulfilled by how our internet distorts and diminishes opportunities for human connection. what do i do when i&rsquo;m feeling the ambient malaise of suspended agency? too often, i go on instagram; i see an uncannily cute dog; i smile to myself; the dread in my stomach grows.


what strikes me about ngai&rsquo;s criticism of cuteness is how it gives a theory to the empty feeling of scrolling. i&rsquo;ve said before that i think the human condition in the 2010s is to scroll. this is the decade of Scrolling. scrolling activates those minor feelings, because it too promises an infinite unresolved aesthetic. i imagine my social media feeds surrounding me, going on forever as though i&rsquo;m traveling through a wormhole in a dated sci-fi film. i am suffocated by my capacity to scroll.


recently exa told me about their scroll-series &mdash; a journal full of drawings that they complete on the subway when they feel the urge to scroll. this has prompted me to renew my commitment to anti-scrolling behaviors (though a similar scroll-series may not work for me; my pen is far too sensitive to a bumpy subway ride). i think i&rsquo;m still going to have those moments where i feel an urge to look through kim kardashian&rsquo;s most recent photos, but i&rsquo;m hoping that organizing my life in a way in which there are many non-scrolling activities available to me will help me expunge the need to scroll from my life. in my mind scrolling is a sort of&nbsp;<em>minor action,&nbsp;</em>that which i engage in out of a suspended agency. as i ask of myself to understand cuteness as more than a commodity aesthetic &mdash; as that which interrogates where it comes from, that destabilizes &mdash; i also ask myself to scroll with intention. i&rsquo;m not entirely sure what this looks like, yet, but i know that it&rsquo;s something i want to genuinely explore. down with the Scrolling Industrial Complex.
