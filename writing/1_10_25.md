i’m lying on the ground in prospect park, right next to olivia. eyes closed, trying hard to stay steady, stay calm. as i relax into the grass of the meadow, i hear rustling, and the barely-perceptible feeling of small objects being placed along my body. we’re doing a ritual, offered by kayra, a ceremonial goodbye to olivia and i as instructors, and a welcoming (rebirth) of us as fellow students of the world. kayra brought leaves from around the city and the park in order to adorn us. as we rise from our “burial” a laugh unexpectedly emerges from both of us — a delight at such a touching moment of transformation at the hands of those who have joined us on a journey of becoming creature.

it’s mid-november in prospect park, and it’s the last class of becoming creature: creature of ritual. to close our class, participants each offered a ritual for the rest of class to participate in, or learn from. some are group activations, while others more personal moments of ritual contemplation. some pertain directly to the class (like kayra’s offering), while others are a regular practice. we spend some time leaning against trees, we bury a jewel in the soil, we take a moment to attend to the built environment around us. not only is it special to experience the different approaches to ritual everyone takes, but learning about the origins of these rituals reveals how intentional secular spiritualism is everywhere. some offerings are already a part of ritual practice, while others were inspired by performance artists, and still others learned from a stranger in a park. when you’re receptive to it, this kind of thing is everywhere.

*when i die, please bury my body like this*

ritual felt like a fitting theme for our final class, and we had to assign *an offering,* by robin wall kimmerer as one of our readings. in the short essay, kimmerer recalls her own journey of relating to ritual ceremonies, and how they carry a complicated relationship to colonial pasts. in participating in a ceremony, kimmerer realizes that it can be a reclamation of that which has been otherwise compromised. in activation, ceremony becomes a source of agency, rather than a sink. i think this can be true, and needs to be true, especially for young secular white people in america. i speak of this group because it is the one i belong to, but the lessons hold for many — it’s no coincidence that all the readings for this week highlighted nonwhite writers. personally, i feel alienated from structures of spirituality and ritual that may have appealed to my ancestors, be they in more ancient forms of organized religion or more recent instantiations of carceral state power. i grew up a reddit atheism kid, so determined to escape the constricting conservativism of my environment in texas. only recently have i began to return to ritual, seeing it as something that makes worlds, rather than eliminates them. thankfully, i have found my way to spaces where i can be a ritualist in my own way, on my own terms, in community with like-minded others. here’s kimmerer: “that, I think, is the power of ceremony: it marries the mundane to the sacred. the water turns to wine, the coffee to a prayer.”

mundane to sacred indeed. creatures have much to show us about mundanity and sacredness. alexis pauline gumbs asks: “how can we listen across species, across extinction, across harm?” and gets specific with it. what can we learn from the ways marine mammals practice echolocation? abbi and i tried this out in a practice with the school of radical attention, imploring participants to try actually echolocating in the streets of dumbo, staying open to what might emerge. this is a creature of ritual practice, too, as we connect the behavior of nonhumans to the edges of possibilities for human experience. translating nonhuman actions into human understanding always requires a speculative leap, one which can take a ritualistic tone. by which i mean ritual is always an “as-if,” always creating or imagining some world. this world is not necessarily a lie, because that which is ritually constructed creates its own conditions for being, and does not need to submit to the rigorous standard of “realness” modernity enforces.

scientific and ritualistic approaches to being may seem antagonistic to one another. frequently, they are. but one of the theses of becoming creature as a class and as an experiment was that this dichotomy should not be assumed; when we bring together rationalist and ritualist approaches, we have the potential for something beautifully expansive. relating to nonhumans is primely suited for this approach, because it can never be complete. our understanding of what it is to be a creature must be uncertain, and so ritual can help us address the uncertainty rather than attempting to defeat it, or ignoring it. what would the world be like if everyone had rituals that were rooted in attempting empathy for the experience of a nonhuman? i think much would be different, in intriguing ways. there would probably be a lot more people at the horseshoe crab migration events, less trash in the beds of street trees, maybe even less drilling for oil or concrete spilling over everything.

*god, the tetraodontidae you put on earth to eat algae are making elaborate mating ritual sand paintings*

still, it’s important to note that while the frame of becoming creature as a class has been explicitly about the more-than-human, much of ritual can not and does not necessary engage the nonhuman. we can engage in practices that seem entirely human, that seem heady and intellectual, and still find ourselves in surprising relation to our nonhuman neighbors. perhaps this is the turn we hoped to prompt in this class — towards spaciousness in how we build up our spirituality, how we experiment with our relations. 

we end this class by going back to my apartment, where i bust out my 25 liter soup pot for the first time since moving here. it feels good. it feels right. my living room is a chaotic cobbling together of people i’m just starting to get to know, buzzing as we pass aroudn hot buttered apple cider and bowls of veggie soup. tiri demonstrates her cyborg cockroaches and soham shares his ritual relationship to slime. this feels like it could be a ritual, too, soup the binding of community, as it so often is (hence the name for raya and i’s practice, tomorrow soup!). this instantiation of becoming creature is over, but the work is hardly finished, because we are always becoming creatures. it’s a lifetime commitment, one that we’re just beginning to explore. looking to the future, my mind is full of possible experiments in rituals that might bring me closer to the more-than-human world. bring me closer to becoming a creature. stay tuned for more; i hope you’ll join us.
