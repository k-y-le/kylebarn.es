in high school we had a trend of digital detoxes. sponsored by the school, teachers were encouraged to use “phone cubbies” for students to keep their phones during class. i remember a dinner with friends (i think it was at the cheesecake factory…) in which we all stacked our phones in the middle of the table — first person to check their phone pays. to some extent, frisco high school was ahead of the curve when it comes to this movement, which has spawned sleepaway camps and self help books and guided meditations. we’re all searching for ways to cleanse ourselves of our parasitic relationship with the digital.

i’m in ecuador, writing from a hostel in a valley between numerous volcanoes, without internet since i arrived four days ago. it’s the longest in a while that i’ve been disconnected, by which i mean without internet connection. i’m still using my devices; my phone as a camera and my ipad as an e-reader and word processor. so while i would hardly describe it as a total detox, i still feel disconnected from the digital. a digital detox is about connectivity, not the devices themselves. it has just as much, if not more, to do with social media than it does to any other aspect of what the phone or laptop or tablet provides. when we disconnect, the device becomes a tool, and what an incredible tool it is! i can read and write and draw and play games and take pictures and do so much more with this magical piece of tech. i’m grateful for this, and don’t want to throw it away with the bathwater.

those were the days...

writing about a digital detox feels cliche, but i’m still engaged in the constant process of understanding my own relationship with technology. writing helps me find clarity in what it is that i want out of technology, both personally and also collectively, since all technology engages the social. my devices are some of the most precious objects i own, but i feel sometimes ambivalent about them. my phone serves as more a burden than a tool, with its broken microphone and battery life that lasts no more than a couple hours, to name just a couple of its flaws. but i remain committed to it, not so much out of a loyalty to the device itself but as a moral stance against the planned obsolescence of apple, the contemporary dependence on connectivity, and the social-environmental extractivism that fuels the disposability of devices. to some extent, my digital detox out here in cotopaxi is tamer than others, since my typical daily screen time levels out at around 45 minutes, and my social media presence is nearly nonexistent. still, i’m intrigued by the detox as a form of coping with the pressures and compulsions of neoliberal capitalism, and as an opportunity to reflect on and imagine something different. something better.

can technology bring us closer? to each other? to the natural world? i’m interested in that which helps us to listen and understand the world around us: a climate model, project CETI, that one constellation app that, every time i go stargazing, everyone seems to have heard of but nobody actually has downloaded. what is it about technology that enables a deeper understanding of what the world is and could be, that activates curiosity, rather than enforcing the simplification of relations into data points? D’Ignazio & Klein: “(data) run the risk not only of being arrogantly grandiose and empirically wrong, but also of doing real harm in their reinforcement of an unjust status quo”. the technology that i wish for as i hike through the ecuadorian forest and encounter new species of flora and fauna is that which would engender the wonder i feel as i learn and understand how the natural world is interconnected. at this moment i’m less interested in a social internet, in connection with others, than with connection to place, to presence. later, though, i’d like to be more connected with those who feel similarly.

such are technology settings. the context by which i want to engage the digital depends on the context around me. one of the core issues with constant connectivity is the demands that it makes on us to flatten our technology settings. we become inescapably entangled with advertising-driven data collection regimes that ask our unending engagement in order to drive a more complete advertising profile. i want a digital for the forest, one that softly allows for a deeper engagement with the place without disrupting my sense of presence with a notification about something happening across the world. i want a digital for human connection, that fosters deeply exciting conversation without demanding a certain form of legibility. most importantly, i want a digital that complements, rather than supplants my relations with community and environment. implicit in all this is the ability to opt-out, to turn off the digital without feeling a negative impact on my psychology.

there’s plenty of deconstruction of the idea of a dream job out there (“i don’t dream of labor”). but i do find something valuable out of imagining my preferred forms of relating to labor. one aspect of my personal “dream job” would involve surfing the internet for 2-4 hours every day. i wouldn’t want bounds on it, and instead want to feel like a literal explorer, perusing and engaging with the ecosystems of the internet. this also means exploring outside the web2.0 of walled gardens full of grotesque attention-optimized engagement traps. why am i still attached to a technology that entraps me? do i have google-meta-apple stockholm syndrome?

this line of thinking dissatisfies me, because it engages with another form of flattening — refusing to disentangle the digital with the ways that the digital has been instrumentalized for corporate hegemony. surfing the internet means endeavoring down a new path of discovery, at its best. it means delight, as you encounter new forms of interaction with the web as a medium, new ways of connecting with others, new information and perspectives. i consider my own practice of creating websites as a small contribution to this space of discovery, outside the stifling constraints of the corporate web (although i do still have to pay for domain names, which are not so cheap…).

when it comes to the social web, i’m most drawn to a curatorial experience. as someone who is constantly making lists, be they playlists or arena channels or bullet points in the notes app, i view curation as a sort of world building exercise. when you put things together, that’s where the world is. it’s not in the individual thing but the connection between the things. it’s interstitial. the magic of curation — and by this i distinctly take it in opposition to the elite form of art world curation, which i find a spiritually offensive practice of taking the life out of an art object — is in its incredible ability to surface new ways of thinking about the world. the exponential number of possibilities that come from bringing together objects, ideas, and forms of knowing feels to me both exhilarating and inspiring. technology is, in my opinion, one of the best ways to accomplish this, because it can combing the accessibility of information with creative constraints to introduce new possibilities of curation. 

so here i am, detoxing. and yet, still, the spectre of technology haunts me, inducing me some sort of trance out of which this essay has emerged. i’m holding precious my probably-naïve optimism about what technology and the internet could be. about what a detox offers in the form of imaginative potential. one more device i’ve brought with me to ecuador: my nintendo switch. playing zelda (tears of the kingdom) into the evening with ben has been an absolute delight, and has actually enhanced our relationship to the natural world, in some ways. of course playing this game could be viewed as a selfish form of escapism, but for us it has colored our relationship with the environment around us. yet another reason for my optimism around technology is how i’ve found that games have augmented and expanded my own sense of worldbuilding. i see a cave on the side of a volcano and imagine what i treasures i would find there were i to explore it. i scale a cliff and imagine myself encountering a shrine or a miniboss, and find myself the protagonist of my own adventure. unexpectedly, my time away from connectivity has introduced in me a newfound appreciation for my devices, as tools for coming closer to the world, and for curation. i’m looking forward to bringing this appreciation back into the interconnected world.
