i think best when i’m moving. i need to remind myself of this. how many times have i felt cornered by frustration, trapped in stasis, calcified? when i’m happiest, i notice myself moving. swaying back and forth while talking with a friend, dancing my way to the bathroom, stretching as i type. i haven’t gone skating in a while, and i’m feeling the lack in my tendons, eager for the stretch that i can only really experience on ice. i miss it in my mind, too, the feeling of clarity that comes from cold air whipping across my face, from gliding and spinning at speeds impossible to reach unaided. excerpt from a journal entry, 10/11: “all i need is cool, crisp air”

funny that thinking is so much the source of human exceptionalism. yet moving is the way of being that makes me feel most connected to the nonhuman. in moving, i am thinking like a creature. thinking like the anti-human. the more-than-human. donna haraway: “why should our bodies end at the skin, or include at best other beings encapsulated by skin?” if i think of my body as porous, i begin to think of it as movement, too. i have always felt an affinity with wind, after all. 

being a body-thinker or movement-thinker feels most close to the animal self. more so than a sonic-thinker, or a visual-thinker, though of course many animals think through these modes as well (and more). maybe what i mean is that body-thinking is so far from the philosopher-borne visions of what being human might really mean. embodiment being, as it was, unceremoniously forced out of the annals of meaning-making by rationalism’s limited scope. 

in middle school, we took these quizzes, aimed at helping us understand our learning styles. are you a visual thinker? auditory thinker? kinesthetic thinker? when i got my results — mostly inconclusive, slight preference for kinesthetic — the advice was laughable. while others got study guides and flashcard tips, i was told to go for a walk in the middle of class, take breaks, try doing some jumping jacks. meanwhile, my teacher kept me stuck at my desk, in the back corner where the bad kids go (was i a bad kid? not the best, if only because i couldn’t hide my disdain for the teacher’s pedagogical style). the only movement allowed was standing up every day to repeat the texas pledge.

sometimes, it feels like embodiment is some sort of buzzword. one of the trendier terms to use in brooklyn. everything is somatic now, somehow, even those events stiff with prestige and status signaling. i feel alienated from the ways in which this word tends to operate, even among fellow artists experimenting with somatic experience. so attached, as it is, to a sense of importance, of holier-than-thou, of wellness and healing and projection of those ideas. 

i am interested in a craggy body. an embodiment that is weird, fuzzy, frequently incorrect. less yoga teacher, more kid looking for worms, caked in mud. a lot of people who have things to say about the body seem strangely reticent to dance. seem attached to the idea that bodies hold some truths in them, some salvation. i know my body will not save me, but it can move me. i’m working on this, too, the fear-of-dancing, the body-as-savior. here’s sophie strand: “let me swing past wellness into something wilder and less predictable.”

that’s it — the wild. on january 1, 2024, i decided that creature would be my word of the year. now it is, also, the subject of the [class i teach with olivia](https://www.notion.so/e7ad5fc6aece4d6f9a48a7be0508e6df?pvs=21). i want to become creature because i want to be more in my body and less in my head. i want to be more gooey, more porous — i want to let the wild movement in. and i want to find that balance of body and head and sight and sound while maintaining my practices. like this one — writing. another irony, perhaps, that i proclaim to think best while moving, and yet i sit in this cafe and write.

i should be outside, rolling around in the grass. i should be following my impulses, taking a bite out of the leaf that hovers near my ear. (it seems delicious, for some reason, but i might just be hungry). but writing is also how i sense the world. i am becoming creature, but i am also human. some chimeric hybrid. thinking-moving-writing-creaturing my way into the good life. 

in january, in my quest to live 2024 as creature, i read *wild things: the disorder of desire* by jack halberstam. i hardly took close notes — i rarely do — and so i’ve found it bubbling through the cracks of my life in sometimes-surprising ways. one of the challenges that wildness poses, through the book and otherwise, is how it emerges unscripted and anarchic, much like the experience of childhood itself. it absconds legibility and threatens one’s grasp on normative structures, including (important!) that of normative goodness. i enjoy halberstam’s rejection of a natural queerness or even queer ecology, because in those claims i sometimes feel an echo of the alienation that arises in me when bodies are held up as redemptive. wildness and queerness, for me, are not inherently *good,* they just are. same with creature. i want to become creature because it widens the space of possibility for things like the movement-thinking which was trained out of me so swiftly by the education system. but i also want to become creature because it feels to me like it touches on some more raw and vulnerable state of being, but one that keeps me skin-to-skin with what it means to live well in damaged times.

*“If the wild has anything to tell us, it is this: unbuild the world you inhabit, unmake its relentless commitment to the same, ignore the calls for more, and agree to be with the wild, accept the wild, give yourself to the wild, and float or drown in its embrace.”* — jack halberstam
