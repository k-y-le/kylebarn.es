left work early today. i wanted to go to the park, enjoy our last days of warm weather. that’s a phrase i’ve been saying for weeks, in this unreasonably pleasant autumn, in which each weekend feels like the last one to hit 70 degrees. i needed to feel the texture of grass on my toes. the sun warming my skin. 

the thing is, there’s not so much to it — the good life. it’s toes in the grass, changing of the seasons, a beautiful song, the embrace of a loved one. why do we end up complicating things? this morning, ben was teaching me about the different trees at mcgolrick park.

i think i need to read bullshit jobs. i think i need to work for the parks department. i think i need to know every single tree on my block. it feels to me as though there are two kinds of pursuits: those that turn towards complexity, and those that turn away from it. as i dive deeper into complexity through my work, i find myself drawn away from complexity in my routines. am i splitting myself unevenly? my neuroscientist colleague tells me that it’s not really possible to multitask well. still, while i want to know every tree and bird and beetle, i also want to know alternative economics and generalizable robotic intelligence and physics-informed neural operators.

at brooklyn bridge park, a fashionable gay couple brought their rabbits. they’re two long haired beauties (the rabbits, not the couple, though i almost asked one of them where he got his pants) — one brown, one speckled with almost-cowprint. i’ve never seen someone bring rabbits to the park before, but maybe that’s just what happens on a wednesday at 3:30pm. they caused quite a stir among passersby, not least the kindergartners walking through on what seems to be an afterschool program. the kids keep trying to stealthily escape the eyes of their teacher, get a closer look at the rabbits as they obliviously munch on grass. being five year olds, they aren’t very good at it, but i can sense that the teacher wants to get closer, too, her admonishments of the escapees somewhat limited in vigor. this moment feels momentous, for some reason, more so than the towering skyscrapers of the financial district just across the water. 

some of the best things in life, for me, are those which tie things together, rather than wrenching them apart. i’m talking about the complexity thing, here. sometimes, when we get closer to complexity, we realize the simplicity. sometimes, we come together over something weighty, and find ourselves mostly just hanging out. sometimes, we’re distracted from the monumental towers of financial power by two pet rabbits. 

lately, i’ve been wondering about ambition. i’m someone who loves projects, loves to start things. ambition has driven me from suburban texas to the ivory tower of the ivy league to a high paying job working on complex problems in the heart of the empire. along the way, i’ve practiced somewhat of a healthy detachment from ambition at its most incisive, but it’s no coincidence that my path has led me here. ambition is coproduced with socially constructed notions of success; that which appears desirable becomes desirable. i don’t think this is particularly novel, or surprising to me. it’s no shocking revelation, but more of a continuing negotiation — i am not one to stand outside a system in order to shape it. still, standing with my toes in the grass, rabbits munching, the city’s teeth bared in front of me, i’m reminded of the balance i seek, the possibilities that appear when you take time to attend to the world in all its becoming.
