last week’s creature class was all about knowing. we interrogated intelligence, reading about spiders and extended cognition and octopuses and reimagining biology. we practiced nonhuman forms of knowing by doing exercises that defamiliarized us from language, and that offered tools for thinking like a spider. i found it a bit surprising that it was quite difficult to design embodied activities that allow us to inhabit another form of intelligence. it can require a particularly well-designed apparatus to understand what it is like to learn, remember, and problem solve as another being. i wish this weren’t a niche thing, and indeed it was difficult to find many examples of projects which take this question seriously. a world in which nonhuman intelligences are emulated and respected seems likely to be one permeated by more care. still, practices like biomimicry remain primarily showpieces, lightly implemented if at all, or relegated to an idealized conception of traditional ecological knowledge.

i find this frustrating. the challenges of our current moment ask us, with urgency, to stop talking about the thing and actually practice it. it’s easy to claim that we should repair our relationship with capital-N Nature, but actually doing the work requires attempting, again and again, to do so, creatively and with ambition. too often, the institutions we look to in order to inspire change to systems are captured by the cycle of talking-about rather than doing-about. i’m talking about academia, of course, but philanthropy is hardly an exception. creative industries, too, frequently seem mired in the appearance of the thing, rather than the relations of the action. to whatever extent possible, i want to prioritize trying to do things. i don’t believe this to be too complicated, but feels important for me to repeat, even just to myself, as i attempt to make sense of the possibilities for living well.

an important theme of thinking ecologically is that understanding — and, therefore, empathizing with — nonhumans will always be speculative. we can never know as the spider, nor know the spider, only approximate its experience through experiments. yet another harm of mythologized objectivity is in its tendency to train us to believe that we should know, completely, in order to make decisions. this is radically humbling. in attempting to think as a spider, through scientific experiments, reading about it, or — as was the case in class — via a rope-based “web” apparatus we come against the limits of our own knowledge. not even our own knowledge, but our own ability to know. the human form facilitates its own considerable range of experience, but even that is a minuscule sliver in comparison to the breadth of nonhuman ways of being. this is why i remain enamored with attempts to prod the porous boundaries of human knowing, be they through art practices, science experiments, body modification, or immersive experiences. each case asks humans to accept the unknowability of experience, even the extent of difference among us, and widen the space of possibility for living otherwise. what mystery!

experimenting and practicing with creaturely intelligence is also important for reframing conversations (and, more importantly, actions) on artificial intelligence. our world is rife with intelligences — it’s frustrating to see so many resources directed towards artificial general intelligence and other sci-fi fantasies when the viability of any form of intelligence is so clearly about social acceptance, rather than performance. objectivity strikes again. if only a fraction of the resources devoted to developing artificial intelligence were diverted to understanding and exploring the possibilities of other nonhuman intelligences, we would not only have a more spacious capacity for relations with the environment, but artificial intelligence itself would likely benefit greatly. AI, itself, seems to me like a nascent creature, still molded by the world. we would do well to treat it as such.
