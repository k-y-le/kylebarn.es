i&rsquo;m on the f train in gowanus and the canal is shimmering, catching the light and throwing it out across new york city. i see this and think <em>i&rsquo;m undone.</em> surely, i&rsquo;ve been laid bare by the magnificence of this moment. but i&rsquo;m not undone. my shoulders are tensed, my jaw clenched without my realizing it. you&rsquo;re not undone, kyle, you&rsquo;re just feeling an indescribable openness through the chest. you&rsquo;re not undone, you&rsquo;re just made brilliantly aware of the interconnected beauty of the world. but maybe that&rsquo;s undoing. deborah bird rose: &ldquo;the term bir&rsquo;yun [translated from Yolngu as &lsquo;brilliant&rsquo; or &lsquo;shimmering&rsquo;] &mdash; which does not distinguish between domains of nature and culture &mdash; is characteristic of a lively pulsating world, not a mechanistic one. bir&rsquo;yun shows us that the world is not composed of gears and cogs but of multifaceted, multispecies relations and pulses.&rdquo;


recently, olivia and i were talking about where interior feelings are located in the body. the vulnerability of truly letting oneself relax into an experience with another person, a prodding into the complexities of the body-mind. there&rsquo;s an intriguing joy to discovering that the body knows something the mind has not figured out yet. maybe that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m naming, in my undoneness. i&rsquo;m searching for ways to make sense of what i do and do not understand about my body. the feeling of shimmer from the f train at seven am.

<h6 style="text-align: center;">i&#39;m commissioning a new study just to label my extremely specific emotions as i experience them</h6>

i am both a feeling and unfeeling person. and i find myself wishing for more of the feeling, to feel deeply attuned to my body. where do you carry your stress? a friend asks. i&rsquo;ve never really known the answer, honestly. i still don&rsquo;t.


the morning of the shimmer i took a bike ride through prospect park. away from the direction of work, away from the responsibilities of a busy week, away from the feeling that others are counting on me and my performance. maybe this is running away, but i think of it more as a listening to my body. one of the more &ldquo;feeling body&rdquo; things i&rsquo;ve done in a while. it might be that this pursuit is what unlocks the shimmer and its hold on me.


<em>feeling body</em> by nyokabi kariuki is a twelve and a half minute long song of mostly field records. dripping water, incantations, &ldquo;you have to quietly deal with the fact that it might be over&rdquo;, footsteps, all decorate its sonic environment. she writes this piece to navigate the process of encountering long covid, learning to live with a changing body. i&rsquo;m interested in how we make sense of these moments of radical departure from the body/mind as we know it. it&rsquo;s part of what draws me to mourning as a political and artistic practice. in grief, as in illness, we have to contend with a self that becomes forever changed in its loss/transformation. i&rsquo;m thankful to kariuki for inviting me into her experience of this transformation.


there&rsquo;s a certain awareness of the feeling body that comes with illness. like how i&rsquo;m always reminded of my own privilege (no allergies) each spring, when i am bursting with eagerness to spend time outside while close friends keep themselves in and rely on allergy meds to get through. it&rsquo;s a somatic experience, but also a political one. illnesses can forge new civics that surface the contrived nature of borders. in toxicity, transcendence. mel chen: &ldquo;indeed, figures of toxicity have moved well beyond their specific range of biological attribution, leaking out of nominal and literal bounds while retaining their affective ties to vulnerability and repulsion.&rdquo;


i think a defining feature of the 21st century is the increasingly porous and absurd nature of borders. as technology, illness, and climate change demonstrate our inseparable entanglements, differences between &ldquo;us&rdquo; and &ldquo;them&rdquo; continue to be re-negotiated. this takes grand scales, as illnesses such as covid unite us ontologically as planetary inhabitants, as sabu kohso writes, but also in the minute, in the ways that we define what is and is not welcome inside the body.


where does my feeling/unfeeling body fit in? what borders do i trace and experience in my body? i&rsquo;m reminded that the gowanus canal is a superfund site, one of the most polluted bodies of water in america. as it shimmers, toxicity leaks. in my lively, pulsating world, shimmer means violence, too. slow violence. when hurricane sandy struck new york city in 2012, the gowanus canal flooded, extending tendrils of contamination into basements and studios. this past friday, an onslaught of rain similarly sent this section of brooklyn temporarily underwater.


in a meeting at work, a scientist shares his software for using satellite imagery to automatically validate biodiversity and reforestation efforts. NGOs want to know not only if their efforts to preserve forests are actually working, but also want to detect leakage: is there increased deforestation right outside the protected zone, indicating a shifting of harm, rather than reduction? this appears as a puffy border zone, overlaid on a satellite view of sierra leone. the leakage zone, another byproduct of the lines we use to divide the natural world.

i&rsquo;m tracing leakage. downpour leaks water through the light fixtures in the ceiling of my kitchen and onto my stove. the gowanus canal leaks more than a century of industry into the studio where i learned woodworking. i leak &mdash; bacteria, heat, dust constantly emanating from my body and into the world we share. my feeling body leaks. i wonder about a feeling canal, a feeling forest. does the forest know where the pain is located? where does a canal carry its stress?


i&rsquo;m compelled to search for systemic influences on my own dissatisfying unfeelingness. what has capitalism wrought on my body? on others? this system, too, leaks. i&rsquo;m trying to see leakage as opportunity, revealing spaces in the world where alternative possibilities can flourish. in my neighborhood a water line leaks and a garden of weeds emerges. the city takes note and this little pocket of life is quickly extinguished. what does it take to see leakage as &ldquo;not an aberration but a form of evidence illuminating underlying flaws in a corrupted system&rdquo; (ruha benjamin)? i&rsquo;m tracing leakage and finding corruption, finding possibility, finding the feeling body.


nobody is unscathed, we are each breathing in particulate matter, each mapping our own contested protected zones, experiencing leakage. the microplastics inside me accumulate each day. in my living, i let them in. am i undone when i see the water shimmer, feel the cold air on my face while biking downhill, leap over a puddle on a rainy night? no, i&rsquo;m still poised, alert, stable, predictable. but at the same time i am, i&rsquo;m being undone by the world around me, unraveling through my years. i&rsquo;m 25 now. this is a recent thing. it makes me feel undone. i&rsquo;m so in love with being alive, even if i don&rsquo;t really know what that feels like. i keep on shimmering and leaking into life.

also- life update: i&#39;m currently on a train to boston, where i&#39;ll be for a week before travelling to europe (london, florence, maybe elsewhere?) -- if you have recs or are in any of these locations, please say hello :D
