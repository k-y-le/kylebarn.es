i’m teaching a couple classes this fall. one is gonna be solo (though still under chimeras collective), it’s called *[a cyborg manifesto: 1985-2025](https://www.notion.so/A-Cyborg-Manifesto-1985-2025-24b6e06b496980d286eac17a78cbb5a4?pvs=21),* and it, as it probably seems, entails doing a close analysis of donna haraway’s *cyborg manifesto* and applying it to our contemporary world. in this newsletter i’m going to share some of my recent thoughts on cycles, companions, heroes, and (of course) cyborgs. but first i just wanted to ask: if you’re reading this, could you share the information about this class with someone(s) you think would be interested? again, i am experimenting with teaching outside of an institution, which means a lot more logistical work, including finding a diverse group of students to form our little cyborg micro-community for five weeks. every little bit does actually help, as i’m hoping this experiment will turn into something beautiful and perhaps repeatable. here’s a little flyer i made:

i first read *a cyborg manifesto* in 2019, at the behest of my college advisor. it was the spring of my sophomore year, and i was looking for a middle path. having already completed my engineering requirements and declared a major of computer science, i felt somewhat locked in to the rigid pathways of the school of engineering. it seemed foolish to throw that all away, but i really wanted to do something different from the uncritical technical research that usually took place in the department. i found myself alienated, after years of being told that because i went to the school with the highest endowment per student in the world, i could do anything i wanted. being anything you want to be sounds great in theory, and the resources did indeed flow at an unreasonable pace, but when in practice over 50% of the student body is going to work in consulting or finance, promises of plural futures become less compelling.

anyways, i’m not sure if i compelled any of that to my advisor when we first met, but she must have seen it in me somehow, as she told me i should read this author donna haraway, that i might find it interesting. at this point it was the middle of finals week, and as i was taking more than the recommended number of classes, i had plenty of assignments to procrastinate on — so i naturally read it right away. i had a sense, one that was confirmed immediately upon reading, that this text would be far more applicable to my life than whatever work i had to do for my theory of computation or fundamentals of machine learning classes. 

it seems strange to me that i’m so drawn to return to haraway’s cyborg now, at a time in my life when i’m less connected to the worlds of tech and computation than i have been since before i even attended college. but it’s been three years now since i moved to nyc post-graduation, and there might be something of a cycle that has me returning to the past at this milestone. peter and i talk about returning to the thing you studied, years later, with a fresh appreciation for why you were drawn to it in the first place. i think life is about finding yourself, losing yourself, finding yourself again. because we are always shimmering, always changing. because the “true self” is a fiction we can learn to let go of.

donna haraway taught me this. so did others, like judith butler, gilles deleuze, james baldwin. but others, too, like e-coli, hummingbirds, the ocean. not all companions are humans. in my life, i’ve been fortunate enough to count a cat, a harbor, a mountain, a lighter, a piece of broken mirror, an incense holder, a burnt tire remnant, a bud vase, and more all as companions. some texts, too, like *a cyborg manifesto,* have been and continue to accompany me through this living. 

haraway is probably one of the closest people to a hero that i can claim. but i’ve never been one to label myself a fan, disinclined toward parasocial relationships. fan culture is weird, usually about coveting and consuming someone rather than empathizing with the experience of the person behind the idol. but i have read most things donna haraway has written, have agreed with most of what she has to say, and have returned to her writing again and again, in the case of the cyborg. 

teaching this class is an experiment (like most things i’m doing these days) in something a bit more intellectual/academic than the classes olivia and i have taught before. it’s kinda the class i always wanted to take in college but was never offered. i feel nervous to teach it, because it will be my first time teaching in a non-institutional way alone, and because i’m making a claim to some authority of knowledge over something that’s been deeply studied and examined for four decades now. but i think that the cyborg truly is a guiding figure for thinking through the current world of developments, and the imbrication of technology + power that is the engine behind ICE, behind AGI panic, behind captivating social media. Paulo Freire long said that truly transformative learning comes through teaching, and I believe that the combination of teaching + writing about (more on that soon, some stuff i am excited to share…) a concept allows me to more fully understand living well in relation to it. so i have many hopes for this next foray into my own experiment as a teacher: that i come in contact with a growing community of cyborg-types, that i more fluidly integrate the cyborg into my own responses to the techno-horrors of our current age, that i contribute to growing political community, that i have fun exploring a companion text. perhaps most of all, i hope to find new mysteries to explore, next experiments to conduct, and new ways to live well as a cyborg.
