been investigating my dreams lately. going one step further than my usual, which is a dump and go (the destination of the dump being either my notes app or a nearby friend). but a creative life means pursuing the strange, the uncanny, the serendipitous. olivia and my first collaboration was an event inspired by my recurring dream of a cursed scarab beetle amulet. that’s the kind of investigation i’m talking about. what’s the next beetle event, for me?

on friday night, i dreamt about a cafe that i’ve never been to before. upon waking up, i knew it as i sign that i had to go and check it out. as it turns out, i knew the barista — we’d met at a party before. these little joys are what i’m questing for, in my dream investigations. little moments, little journeys.

a dream is a pattern. a scramble, a subconscious remix. in my dream of the cafe, there’s a table of worms. a glass top covers a compost-type vibe where i get to watch them squirm while i sip my espresso. i could go further: what might the worms represent? what should i be composting in my life? but i’m not much of one for analysis. instead, i want to sleepwalk towards a deeper relationship with the dream. to move, dreamlike, in the direction of dreaming.

what does it mean, to move dreamlike? i’m not sure i could convey it in writing. but at peter’s birthday on friday, amber and i started mimicking a falling leaf. the float, the flutter, the fall. happy falling leaves full moon!

is a leaf falling the dream of the tree, fulfilled? something catches on that word: fulfillment. we’re so often searching for it, but i’m not convinced we’re very good at defining it. a fulfilled life might mean certain markers: access, wealth, prestige. but these stories are tired; my dreams desire differently. they show me a world otherwise. worms in the tables.

but dreams are also intentions, visions, manifestations, desires. at olivia, vicki and emily’s park pop up, olivia asks a couple posing for a portrait about their dreams. the man responds that he doesn’t really have any, and his girlfriend immediately ridicules him for the response. besides being an amusing anecdote of gendered ambition, this moment makes me realize that i’ve been living my life immersed in intention. the other day my climbing partner asked me what themes connect my friends together in my life. it takes some time to come up with a response, but i tell her that i think it’s intention. a commitment to living an intentional life, whatever form that takes. investigating, interrogating, but also embracing, not escaping.

at czarina’s birthday she says her wish for the year is to stop self-actualizing. fellow virgo, i share this view. i’ve actually practiced quite a lot of bringing intentionality into my life. and now, by investigating my dreams, i bring an intentionality to being unintentional, if that makes sense. by this i mean that i’m not trying to “make sense” of my dreams, or absorb a lesson. instead, i want to cultivate the absurd, to let the wild roses bloom. let my internal garden be a messy vibrant meadow.

a joy of life — a fulfillment, even — lies in exploring the strange places my subconscious takes me. i used to have this recurring dream that i can only best describe as essentially an experiment in particle diffusion. it was a nightmare, really, that mostly kept happening around age five. what kind of five year old is having nightmares about particle physics? i’ve asked this question many times, but i think if there exists an answer, i don’t want to know it, to allow the mystery of the scary particles to remain a stone in the foundation of my psyche. sometimes, i think that contemporary norms around therapy can give us the false notion that everything in our minds can be excavated. all traumas uncovered, assigned meaning, vanquished in the name of mental health. perhaps, perhaps not.

sometimes, when i wake up with a dream still cupped in my palm, i rush to write it down, quick as i can. while i watch it slip between my fingers, i scramble to deposit it within my notes app. the results are often quite humorous, as they are, usually, awash in morning delirium, replete with typos and run-ons. here’s an example:

i collect these fragments of my life, of my mind, often in my notes app. i am grateful for this, to retain a deep curiosity towards my own mind. even as i explore it further, i retain a hope that i might remain somehow illegible to the machine. please, no AI models trained on my notes app. although i’m sure they might come up with something creative and funny. there’s something of a possibility here. in cultivating illegibility as resistance. to be strange, quirky, non-relatable. to keep from prompt-engineering my mind away. all the technologies i use shape the ways i think, decide, and connect. my dreams, too, are surely shaped by all this screen time. 

all of this is a fancy meandering way to say that i’m trying to get weirder. if anyone wants to do some reps at the dream investigation gym, lmk.
