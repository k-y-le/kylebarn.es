i’m so pissed about the spotify smart shuffle feature. in which, when attempting to put a playlist on shuffle, spotify will automatically switch to their smart feature, weaving in algorithmic recommendations that were never a part of the playlist to begin with. not only is it a blatant way to push their lucrative algorithms into somewhere they previously were not, but it also disrupts the flow of playing my music, as there’s always a lag while spotify loads the recommendations, which means i can no longer quickly switch to shuffle. it’s trivial, but has been grating on me for months — particularly because it has only made the experience worse, for me. i see not a single benefit.

i don’t want anything smart anymore. all my smart devices become dumb, and i keep holding onto them, like a child with their threadbare toy, out of a stubborn refusal to buy the next greatest $1000 thing on the market. instead i’m surrounded by the former gifted kids of the consumer electronics world, forced to reckon with their fall from grace, their rapid depreciation, their draining battery. it’s a tumultuous journey, that which brought my smart devices into being and inevitably sends them back to be disassembled for parts, a strange *flowers for algernon* experience for an iphone. here’s systems ultra [find author name]: “human-made things do not cleanly emerge into the world at the end of a tidy process, but are tugged and tossed around by social and political forces that shape what these things are and will be.”

one of the illusions of so-called-smartness is classic of capitalism — that demand drives supply. but are we asking for these things? the symptom of a smart world gone dumb is that the smartness is always to appease some force, some other. who wants a talking fridge? a smart pillow? surely some, but surely not most. we pretend we have no control over these things, all us cogs in the machines. ask a ceo why they can’t change their practices and they’ll cite the system. they’ll lose their competitive advantage, their IP, their edge. the ultimate ruler over us all. the system says we can’t divest from israel. that we can’t stop burning fossil fuels, can’t abolish prisons.

i feel guilty getting upset with spotify over their smart shuffle feature, when i should be directing my anger to countless other things of more importance. but, at risk of trivializing or normalizing, i believe in the connectedness of everything, including the enduring shitting of our smart technologies and the enduring war machine of our politics and the enduring exploitation of our financial system. i believe most people are experiencing this dissatisfaction with contrived smartness; even google seems to be becoming less and less reliable, particularly with their AI search results feature.

one connection is through suspended agency. [something about leavitt cohn on software as a timely object]. software loops into other lifetimes, other cycles of life and death where the life and death of a feature (like smart shuffle) is made inconsequential. as something inconsequential, it makes sense from the developer perspective to extract what you can from the thing, without consideration of the longer-term longevity of the product. when your primary horizon is a quarterly financial report, so what if you alienate some users with a hastily implemented buggy feature? they’re still locked in, what with your monopolistic practices of disrupting regulatory norms and squeezing the lowest common denominator (the artist, the creator, the attention of the user) for whatever you can get.

where am i in my software? in my government? the answer put forth by neoliberalism is through the wallet. which, as we know, has been soooo successful for crypto. that’s the libertarian dreamworld — wallet as vote, wallet as identifier, wallet as accesspoint for culture. but i can trace much of where i really am in my software, spotify at least. i’m in my playlists, which at this point number roughly 1500, and which i have been tending to for years. for months now, however, i’ve struggled to find the motivation to clean up my latest playlists, which remain unsorted, without a cover image or a description, as i’ve carefully added for each of the 1400 previous. it’s no coincidence that my dip in motivation followed the appearance of the smart shuffle feature, yet another way that spotify has disappointed me in recent years. i feel particularly betrayed because i’m so locked into the system, with the prospect of exporting my playlists and transferring to a new platform daunting and disruptive. spotify is not just how i listen to music, but how i remember. so it would be great if i could vote with my wallet, or if they listened to the complaints i’ve made numerous times at this point about their cash-grabby product updates. instead i’m stuck here, betrayed, wading through my suspended agency. i’m surronded by smartness, and instead of feeling empowered, i feel disempowered, as i feel myself entangled deeper and deeper in a web of technology that i cannot detach myself from. this is the way of smartness, another cheap trick of capital to get some product manager a promotion and some venture capitalist a little money in their wallet. good riddance.
