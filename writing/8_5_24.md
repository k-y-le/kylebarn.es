i have memorized the default apple alarm. when i hear something resembling it, i can clearly anticipate the next ring. a shudder runs through me when i hear the distinctive tone. so why haven’t i changed it? these things become comfortable, become stasis. i forget that i *can* change it, and it works fine for me, so why bother? it’s been years since i’ve changed the format of my lock screen on my phone, and i have no interest in shaking it up more. besides, i hardly use most apps. 

i’m curious about this because every once in a while i realize that changing up something so simple as my alarm tone can really freshen up how i start my day. it’s not so hard to be intentional, but it takes some form of prompting to shake me from my complacency. as we go about our lives, what prompts guide us out of our default states of suspended agency? and can these prompts comprise the foundation of a politics of refusal?

in order to orient one’s life towards awe and wonder, which to me are some of the most generous emotions, we must develop practices of intention. because i truly find the possibility of using a smartphone awe-inspiring, but only when i’m shaken from the mundanity of its role in the everyday. as tools, our devices become extensions of our minds, and thus are folded into our conception of normativity. 

i love rearranging my bedroom. when i do so, it feels fresh, new. i’m excited to spend time creating again. but i also feel an urge to rearrange my computer (my home device). my digital life mirrors my physical life, and so i’m building practices of disruption for both my physical and digital selves.

“wash every bowl, every dish as if you are bathing a baby - breathing in, feeling joy; breathing out, smiling. every minute can be a holy, sacred minute. where do you seek the spiritual? you seek the spiritual in every ordinary thing that you do every day. sweeping the floor, watering the vegetables, and washing the dishes become holy and sacred if mindfulness is there. with mindfulness and concentration, everything becomes spiritual” - thich nhat hanh, from *how to eat*
