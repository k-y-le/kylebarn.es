it&rsquo;s december 23. the 23rd has always felt poignant to me &mdash; I get the sense that important things happen on the 23rd. I have a sense that the world will end on the 23rd, or maybe my life. something powerful, arresting, magnificent. a tsunami, an explosion, a revolution. i have absolutely no evidence to back this up. but every month the 23rd rolls around, and i brace myself.


i start my day with writing, a shower, dotting at the stains on my table runner from last night&rsquo;s dinner party. the table is still pulled out into the middle of the kitchen, so that i feel like, sitting here alone, i&rsquo;m awaiting a grand audience. but there&rsquo;s nobody here; i am alone for this day, only. tonight, a dear friend arrives. tomorrow, preparations begin for our christmas day feast.


finding a balance between alone time and together time requires constant negotiation. with oneself, and with others. recently, i&rsquo;ve been uncertain if i&rsquo;m prioritizing enough alone time. i&rsquo;m a very independent person. what does this mean? i am mostly untethered, i expand into the time and space afforded me. i seek out company primarily in very intentional ways. as of late, i&rsquo;ve been luxuriating in togetherness; late nights laying on the floor with friends and roommates, the prolonged embrace of a lover. but i&rsquo;m wondering if my absence of solitude is impacting my mental clarity. times of crisis (all the time) are times of coming together, but they also can be times of muddled thoughts, an unease that spreads.


i am a lucid person, alone. but i am also sometimes a worse version of myself. i scroll, i overeat, i mope. some of this is important &mdash; a wintering, a <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/03/06/wintering-katherine-may/">&ldquo;tending to the inner garden of the soul&rdquo;</a>. i&rsquo;m working on embracing the fact that it&rsquo;s human nature to not-always be happy, optimistic. despite what our online forms of connecting, so full of likes, may tell us. seasonality is one of the reasons i love living in nyc, the feeling of a dynamic world that i am just a small part of is stronger here than anywhere else i&rsquo;ve lived.

as always, i am watching myself become other. i recognize it, sometimes, the changes to myself. i try to understand them and feed them where they ask to be fed. but sometimes they are unfamiliar, unsettling, strange. i see this in others, too. i&rsquo;m pushing back against the impulse to alter who i am so that i can fit some idea of what i should be doing or becoming in this moment. it&rsquo;s the 23rd and i&rsquo;m stretching into my changing self.


halfway through, i&rsquo;ve stopped reading a book that i really enjoy. <em><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374279349/theundying">the undying</a></em> by anne boyer has eleven subtitles: <em>pain, vulnerability, mortality, medicine, art, time, dreams, data, exhaustion, cancer, and care.</em> and while it&rsquo;s a compelling book with stunningly liquid prose, i&rsquo;m just not ready to think deeply about breast cancer, right now. i feel like adding a new hyperobject to my daily contemplations risks further muddling my mental clarity.


lately there&rsquo;s been too many books &mdash; too much beauty. i don&rsquo;t actually mean this, of course: too much in the sense of there being an unjustifiable amount, an offense. i don&rsquo;t see the world as a rotting fruit, sticky and saccharine. instead, my frustration stems from my own perceived inability to take it all in. i cannot eat the fruit; still, i crave it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/21jr8ZZ2kORdz7obzSAGYR?si=c03d161a2bf04c8a">I AM A SPATIAL BEING</a> is the name of a playlist from february 2020, before the pandemic thrust a new illness into the hallways of my mind palace. i&rsquo;m just keeping up, i tell jesse over the phone, while scrolling through reports of unspeakable violence continuing to pile up across the world.


the brain can only handle so much devastation at a time. and we each have our thresholds. i am grateful that i have not had to deeply test this threshold within myself, but i do feel it becoming porous, holes poked made wider by my unsustainable media diet. the microplastics have found me here, too, i think. hiding out in my psyche, forming foreign bodies. but i myself am a foreign body; i am unknowable to myself. i keep trying, learning the names of microbes and parasites hanging out in my large intestines. but i will never know me. and nobody will. there&rsquo;s something comforting about this &mdash; the reassurance that any attempt to label me will fall short, that i can chuckle to myself at the inside joke that i am not what anybody thinks i am. including myself.


it&rsquo;s too much for my flowering body. my face is starting to break out &mdash; too much sugar. i think it might be too much suffering, too acutely unassailable. i am doing fine. i am eating cake and having dinner parties and waking up on the 23rd to a house still echoing with remnants of laughter from the night before. the brain can only handle so much devastation, not out of weakness, but out of distraction. i&rsquo;m asking myself to hold so many things in my mind at once, but to tell the truth i don&rsquo;t think i even know what it means to &ldquo;hold&rdquo; something. part of the therapized vernacular of the current age is to say &ldquo;i&rsquo;m holding space&rdquo; or &ldquo;i&rsquo;m holding your feelings&rdquo; of some sort. but what does this even mean? i am a spatial being, but actually my mind is no palace. there&rsquo;s no space in there; there&rsquo;s nothing to hold.


i imagine taking an adderall to mourn. something to really make me focus. what i really mean is to medicate away distraction, to enforce focus. medicating away the grief. it&rsquo;s very american, looking to medicine to assail myself of my systemic woes. there it is again, another interconnected topic to hold in my mind. to weave into the nonexistent fabric of my neurons. overmedication. file it under neoliberalism, industrial complexes, biopolitics. i should re-read foucault. i should start analyzing pharma patents.

for all its eleven subtitles, i expected boyer&rsquo;s book to dwell less on the cancer and more on its other topics. this is not a critique. it&rsquo;s cohesive, incisive, i can see it resonating in the mind of a middle-aged suburban woman as much as it does for me; maybe more. it borrows from the meandering self-analysis of barthes or maggie nelson, but shifts to a form that feels palatable to an audience that isn&rsquo;t made uncomfortable by queerness, by anal sex. my own writing feels challenged by the need to make a cohesive argument, to stay on topic. make a word count. maybe i should write about anal sex. maybe i should write about breast cancer.


as throughout my life, i can&rsquo;t stop musing on my own legibility. how to share myself, how to make it, how to live the ambitious beautiful artful life i know i want, but don&rsquo;t know how to achieve. in our crisis-filled age, the socially expected thing to do is to make oneself small. selflessness is a virtue. abnegation. of course, this is muddled by the encounters of social media &mdash; becoming small is becoming large, on instagram. it becomes about leveraging brand and audience. buzzwords abound. i&rsquo;m so fucking annoyed by &ldquo;community.&rdquo; i&rsquo;m so fucking annoyed by &ldquo;holding you.&rdquo; language holds me back. no, it doesn&rsquo;t hold, it just limits. and yet, i write.


i think of my mind like a liquid &mdash; it fills up the space it&rsquo;s given. it loves to ooze into new realms of thought, take on new ideas and concepts and connect them across space. lately, my thoughts on legibility have been emerging out of very practical conversations on branding and self. my fellowship ends in september; i need to figure out how to make money and survive in nyc. i want to figure out how to freelance, which requires making clear the &ldquo;value-add&rdquo; of my own presence. why am i worth spending money on? i can make a delicious soup. i can host an artful party. i&rsquo;m an adept soccer player; a better figure skater. i&rsquo;m tall, and can reach the food on the highest shelves. i&rsquo;d like to think i can dress well. can my own liquid brain become a marketable asset? will it get me clients, money, freedom? or will the act of curating my external self stunt the oozing of my liquid brain?


i am a voracious thinker, self proclaimed. but this is also the source (or effect) of my procrastination, which has lately also expanded in size. all procrastination is emotional, olivia tells me. i wonder if i am emotionally detached from my job, my life, my neighborhood and my art practice. i wonder if i am emotionally impaired because i recoil at &ldquo;holding space.&rdquo; i am an independent person. i am just keeping up, i repeat to jesse, for the third time. i am figuring it out as i go.

i put down the boyer book, pick up my new infatuation &mdash; <em><a href="https://tinhouse.com/book/the-seas/">the seas</a>,</em> by samantha hunt &mdash; a novel that&rsquo;s absurd, shifting, romantic, endearing, eerie. i&rsquo;m listening to a song by eerie wanda. <em><strong><strong>don&rsquo;t grow away,</strong></strong></em> she sings. there are many ways to divide a life, and i consider dividing my life into before and after reading this book. i can&rsquo;t say it will have such a strong impact on me, but i think it might. i want it to. i want to feel changed, in a way that i can point to. i can write about it in my newsletter. imagine going by a stage name with &ldquo;eerie&rdquo; in it. every day putting on the face of eeriness.


am i eerie? what is eerie about my life? late stage capitalism produces eeriness as an affect. the absurdity of globalized flows of capital, the systemic backbending done to obfuscate abuses of power in peripheries to those who hold power in the center manifests in strange and uncanny circumstances. the eerie, the spooky, the haunted &mdash; these appear as currents in my life. i don&rsquo;t control them, they pull me along, regardless of my wants or desires. i feel this pulling as a splitting open, at times, a recognition that i am undone by my relations to systems of exploitation and abuse. <strong><strong>the seas</strong></strong> finds eeriness in the quietly arresting thoughts of an unreliable female narrator who believes she is a mermaid. but in this one person is also the eeriness of localized impacts of climate change, which she sees in the flooding of her basement. or the eeriness of war, in the unsettling behavior of her not-quite-lover jude, and in the horrific stories he finally lets out in an inflection point in their relationship.


i&rsquo;m trying to decide if the 23rd is an eerie date. i don&rsquo;t think so; i actually find it quite forthcoming in its gravitas and magnificence. eeriness creeps, it haunts. withers when directly looked at. am i eerie? i think if you looked directly at me &mdash; like right exactly at me &mdash; i would wither, too. i am haunted by the systems around me and within me. i am a mess of creatures and almost-creatures inside my body. i think of myself as an almost-creature, a becomingness. the uncanny valley of my unknowable self. the always ongoing transformation into some new cyborg configuration. thus is life. thus is living, i think to myself, as i dab the stain on my table runner some more, and skip to the next song. <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6HwsLuTeG7W4BYeuvSPTsr?si=d836d7dabb444bbf">baby jesus is nobody&rsquo;s baby now</a></em> by julia jacklin. nice. merry christmas.
