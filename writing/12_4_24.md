i recently had the pleasure of seeing a series of short films as part of the [london palestine film festival](https://www.palestinefilm.org.uk/). the compilation, titled *dreams and ghosts,* portrayed hopeful and suspenseful stories of palestinian experience. one short in the screening, *the key* (dir. Rakan Mayasi 2023), particularly stuck with me for its use of psychological suspense and horror tropes to depict settler guilt. in the film, an israeli family developing and living on a west bank settlement recently stolen from palestinians begin to hear noises in the night of someone attempting to break into their house. their paranoia mounts until even their doctor starts shooting at his door in the middle of the night.

i think it stuck with me in particular because of the familiarity of this kind of settler defense paranoid fantasy. growing up in texas, i learned that for many, property is more valuable than a stranger’s life. the common (but not ubiquitous! don’t give up on the south please) texan relation to property is reliant upon carefully guarded borders; this extends beyond the home to the rio grande and even to imagined threats such as the gender neutral bathroom. beyond the violence of it, this kind of relation strikes me as particularly lame. how pathetic to be afraid of your neighbors, so unwilling to address your porousness that you resort to firearms to protect yourself from facing the trouble of existing with others.

it can be easy, sometimes, for americans to pretend like we aren’t also living in haunted landscapes. it’s the same logic of the israeli settler in *the key* that places us at odds with the history of the land we occupy. colonialism has always relied upon a kind of wilful ignorance of the settler. indigeneity is displaced until it can be forgotten. or, in the case of multiculturalism among liberals, until it can be celebrated. while willful ignorance for the conservative manifests in gun-wielding refusal to engage one’s neighbor, for the liberal it carries a much more palatable appearance.

but it’s still willful ignorance, displacing violence to “forgettable” places that feel distant and therefore unimportant — gaza, favelas, the triangle of death, cancer alley. that which cannot be displaced is integrated. we end up with tikka masala as an english national dish, groups of white americans theorizing traditional ecological knowledge. that which colonialism cannot displace, it dispossesses. neutralizes.

*the key (2023)*

i’m particularly intrigued by how climate change operates with this dynamic. beyond the obvious connections of settler colonial capitalism with fossil fuel extraction and monocrop agriculture, the social life of climate change troubles the colonial displacement/dispossession playbook. it’s difficult to displace climate change because its impacts are planetary — even as marginalized places experience the brunt of climate crisis, that doesn’t stop fires and floods from knocking on the doors of colonialism’s beneficiaries. this includes me; part of my own interest in climate crisis stems from its immediacy, which i felt earlier in my political consciousness. dispossessing climate change also doesn’t quite work, because of its totalizing, existential nature. so what are we left with? the panic wealthy white liberals feel about climate change reflects their inexperience dealing with other effects of colonial capitalism.

this is part of why i’ve been particularly interested in the idea haunted landscapes, lately. because i think haunting disguises a critique of colonial pasts with an idea that is ostensibly just about climate change. the ghosts that haunt our landscapes are palimpsests; peel back one horror, and another three look back at you. raya and i wrote [in our thesis](https://tomorrowsoup.com/mournfuldesign) that the power of grief when addressing climate crisis is in how it forces us to get specific about what we’re grieving and why it’s gone, a process that can quickly lead us to the systemic roots of the issue. our haunted landscapes — and all our landscapes are haunted, the pastoral ideal another colonial fantasy of displacement from our troubles — are imbued with traces of past exploitation as well as past reconciliation. here’s anna tsing: “conjuring a future full of pasts, a ghost-ridden future is both a way to move on, and a way to remember.”

both a way to move on, and a way to remember. *the key* doesn’t actually feature any palestinians, instead working with a 5-person cast of israelis. yet the driving force of the film are the ghosts of palestinians upon whose graves the settlement has been built. we honor the past when we ascribe agency to these ghosts, remind each other that *they are still with us,* still have agency even in death. the paranoid texan and the paranoid israeli are living in a ghost-ridden future, but one in which they are unwilling to acknowledge that they are haunted. but if they can begin to acknowledge the ghosts that haunt our climate futures, perhaps that can be a portal to addressing the displacement and dispossession tactics of colonialism. this is an aspirational and optimistic idea, but one that we may as well give a good try. the trouble that arises from anthropogenic climate change and colonial capitalism continues to accelerate — telling and elevating stories like *the key* will be key to bringing us closer to the future we want.
