and i’m going for a walk in prospect park (i wrote this two weeks ago, bear with me! i am not the best at finishing things). my fifth time here in six days — becoming a regular, like i am at public records, bagel world, volleyball saturdays. i’m getting to know the rhythms of this landscape, bit by bit. 

i’m struck by a sense of joy upon walking into a meadow. largely empty, flat, nearly barren. i have always felt an affinity for flat places, something i usually ascribe to my having grown up in the great plains. when i describe where i grew up, i talk about seeing as far as the eye can see from the elevated roads of a highway transfer, one of those spaghetti transitions so emblematic of late 20th century westward expansion. in texas, we take flatness for granted, building parking lots that never fill up and cookie-cutter housing developments that can be copied and pasted anywhere.

i wonder if i am destined to return to this type of place — flat, uniform, brown. me and my plains-body dislocated into arboreal biosphere. but these things are changing, too. i see squirrels burrowing and wonder if such a warm day has exposed the hiding places of their nuts, as the snow melts and erodes packed soil. i worry for the plants that might interpret today’s temperature as a premature sign to unfurl, exposing them to coming frost. as i traverse the meadow my shoes squelch on muddy patches. this is the post-winter melt, in early-winter. atmosphere playing tricks on me.

*i call it flat but this is much more hilly than most of texas anyways*

muddy steps make my mind wonder about melting permafrost, transporting me to siberia. our (climate scientists’) lack of knowledge about the amount of carbon stored in northern permafrost accounts for one of the largest uncertainties in global understandings of the carbon cycle, and potentially one of the most dangerous. only recently, northern permafrost has changed from a carbon sink to a carbon source; as soil thaws, it releases long-stored carbon into the atmosphere. winter emissions now [exceed](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145880/permafrost-becoming-a-carbon-source-instead-of-a-sink) summer absorption of carbon. in new york city, an unseasonably warm winter’s day is a reason for a long walk through the park. in siberia, it’s an accelerant for global warming.

it’s an era of destabilization, as fires and unexpectedly warm weather are more common now than they have been for millions of years. this is especially true for northern latitudes, where temperature changes reach extremes 2-4 times global averages. it’s a spiral; forest fires in siberia release massive amounts of greenhouse gases, while also exposing the permafrost to increased thawing. the arctic is a region on a precipice.

but on a precipice of what? in *how high we go in the dark,* author sequoia nagamatsu takes this uncertainty as a prompt, figuring an ancient awoken plague emerging from siberian permafrost as the principal antagonist in his meandering story about resilience amidst climate-fueled tragedy. and indeed, unknown pathogens likely await, preserved uniquely well in the perpetually frozen ground, now thawing on days like today. it’s unclear how much we really have to worry about the potential for a deadly pandemic to arise from the siberian wilderness, but even its possibility illuminates how much our uncertainty over the coming behavior of this region’s biogeochemical cycles might make the dystopian into reality. 

my senior year of college, i audited a class called *pluriversal arctic,* taught by olga ulturgasheva. in it, we surveyed various facets of Indigenous cosmologies in the arctic, including those of olga’s own Eveny community. climate change threatens the sacred relationship siberian Indigenous communities have with the land, because it is changing in unexpected and unprecedented ways. but olga was keen to impress upon us that the common mistake outsiders make is classically colonial: considering Indigenous peoples as stuck in the past, unwilling to adapt to change, powerless to the big bad forces of capital as it destroys their livelihoods. instead, these are frontline communities actively adapting not only their livelihoods but also their cosmologies to the uncertain futures we face. there is a spiritual innovation to the responses arctic peoples are making to climate change, which should remind us of the vibrant agency of marginalized groups to react to oppressive structures.

climate scientists could learn a lot from this. uncertainty over how to interact with uncertainty (ha) is one of the chief anxieties of scientists studying planetary systems. because when you’re thinking with a planet, everything is uncertain. i believe that the spiritual response of siberian communities to melting permafrost and the coordinated scientific response to new carbon sources of unknown capacity (and potential pathogens of unknown structure) have much in common. particularly in a repressive homogenizing regime like that of modern day russia, will we be able to listen to frontline Indigenous groups as they warn us of what is to come? will we be able to learn from their adaptations before (and during) the possible disaster situation of total loss of permafrost, or another deadly pandemic? will we give them voice, expand their agency to continue to adapt, as they have always done? or will they be dismissed as victims to be pitied?

it’s an unseasonably warm day in new york city, and i’m wondering why i can’t just shut up and enjoy it. somehow i’m always making the end of the world out of everything. but i’m also marveling at how just stepping on a piece of muddy earth transports me to the far reaches of siberia — a place i may study but will possibly never visit. to be alive in the 21st century, or at least to be living in the global north in the 21st century, is to develop a sense of the planetary. our technology offers us new thought apparatuses, like cell phones, that extend our cognition, but how far can that cognition go? studying climate systems means uncovering the aliveness of the planet. it means knowing that which is happening in places far away are impacted by things happening close by, in unseeable ways. in a way, it means extending my own cognition to cover the entirety of the planet, even if my understanding is crude, uncertain, unfinished. i am here, in brooklyn, new york, 11215. but i am also in siberia. in permafrost, something i’ve only ever learned about, never experienced. in the flat expanse of the greenlandic ice sheet. in the great barrier reef, even as parts of it disappear. i am here, and i am spread out across the planet, as thin as a cirrus cloud, a part of something so much bigger than myself.
