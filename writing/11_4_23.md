i&rsquo;ve spent half of the last month in london, thanks to the gracious hospitality of linn and nala who have let me stay with them, and it&rsquo;s honestly surprised me with its loveliness. there are expectations i had of the place that strike me as silly in hindsight: that it would be dry and dead, that the people would be markedly unfriendly, that it wouldn&rsquo;t be particularly diverse. i&rsquo;ve tried tracing these assumptions and how they happened upon me, but end up muddled in memories of learning about colonialism for the first time, the 2010s anglophile tumblr craze, and the &ldquo;we won&rdquo; pride of the revolutionary war that is the bedrock of american identity. it felt like an important part of the development of my politics that i didn&rsquo;t have any interest in london, as i tried to redeem my own whiteness from colonial oppression and position myself as ironically alternative to cringe online communities. but i&rsquo;ve been living in london, a bit, and really enjoying it. letting myself lean into my desire for gloomy weather and cozy interiors. learning to listen to myself and what i want out of a life rather than defining myself in opposition to something i deem &ldquo;not good enough&rdquo; whether in political orientation or cringey obsession. london is pretty cool, actually.

<h6 style="text-align: center;">i needed to distance myself from this vibe so bad</h6>

i&rsquo;m beginning to understand this process of listening to myself and rethinking my biases as a kind of anti-stoicism. an unlearning. recently i&rsquo;ve been thinking about a type of guy who is easygoing to a fault. he (and it&rsquo;s usually a he) prides himself on going with the flow, holding few opinions, trusting that everything will work out. usually this is in opposition to some anxious force in his life, be it an insecure girlfriend or stressed out classmate or fussy mother. his trust that things will work out has evidence behind it; most things do work out, whether because they were going to anyways or because said anxious force takes some action to secure the outcome. this is where the &ldquo;to a fault&rdquo; comes in, how this type of guy willfully ignores the labor that goes into ensuring things turn out alright, particularly emotionally. then, when some conflict or challenge arises that is such an obstacle that it&rsquo;s destined to fall apart, he ends up shocked by the outcome, and in the midst of it positions himself as the primary victim, though perhaps his easygoingness accelerated the conflict itself.


i speak a bit from experience here; i&rsquo;ve often been this guy. i feel pride for my own ability to weather conflict and be agreeable, but my easygoingness has certainly, at times, hurt others who i didn&rsquo;t realize were working so hard to maintain emotional equilibrium. for me, anti-stoicism means being more aware of these tendencies in myself, without overcorrecting into a state of constantly trying to anticipate all others&rsquo; possible anxieties. i&rsquo;m someone who holds lightly to the world, in some ways, refusing to hold strong opinions and act as a domineering personality in group settings. i&rsquo;m easygoing in such a way that i also will go along with what the people around me want to do, and will only much later ask myself if that&rsquo;s what i really wanted to do. i&rsquo;m still happy to experience the world as a malleable personality, and i frequently find it abrasive to spend time with folks who are strongly opinionated such that they exercise a disproportionate influence on the social dynamics. however, i see anti-stoicism as a method of being more concrete and direct with my own opinions and desires.


<p style="text-align: left;">it&rsquo;s going okay. i still often wonder if my lack of strong opinions is a personality flaw. but one way that i&rsquo;ve been thinking through this while traveling has been in trying to be a bit more unconventional in my travel. despite visiting seven different cities/towns in italy in the past two weeks (before returning to london), i hardly ever went to the classic tourist attractions (museums, cathedrals, etc), because that&rsquo;s not what i&rsquo;m traveling for. i&rsquo;m much more interested in trying on new routines, learning more about how people live their daily life, and investigating the hidden infrastructures of a new place than checking something off a list. last sunday i spent a lot of time following around a garbage boat in venice.generally, i&rsquo;m also becoming more focused in how i approach my own interests. i&rsquo;m starting to live seasonally; for two or three months at a time, i define a few themes that guide my own creation and consumption. this upcoming season is going to be about chimeras, cornbread, coziness, fitness, and studio. an eclectic assortment, and not particularly aligned with the climatic season i&rsquo;m experiencing, but these are themes that have been bubbling up in my brain for a while, and together encapsulate some of the focused areas i want to develop in my own life in the next two months. i&rsquo;m also having a &ldquo;seeding the season&rdquo; evening next friday 11/10 where i&rsquo;m setting intentions, journaling, and symbolically beginning the season (if anyone in nyc would like to join, just let me know. i&rsquo;m gonna bake cornbread). it&rsquo;s one way that i&rsquo;m developing new rituals for living well.

<h6 style="text-align: center;">it&#39;s like a claw arcade game but on hard mode</h6>

trying on the routine of being a londoner has me questioning what i love so much about my life in brooklyn. the things in london that match (or in some cases exceed) my brooklyn lifestyle fall under a common concept that has been coming up in many of my conversations lately: the village. multiple people have described london as a series of connected villages, particularly when you&rsquo;re outside the capitalism-deluxe commercial zones of central london. defining the village is surely contested (&rdquo;a place where people live&rdquo; came up when nala searched it at dinner the other night), but i&rsquo;m not particularly interested in pinning it down, except maybe in a future essay. what i&rsquo;d say now is that the village is generally about knowing your neighbors, being invested in the lives of your neighbors, developing routines of errands and socialization that are geographically and socially cohesive, and a feeling of scale that is just outside one&rsquo;s ability to know each person or place. it evokes a sense of being a part of something slightly larger than oneself, but not exceedingly so.


to me, the village is about a desirable form of social organization. it&rsquo;s actually quite simple in its premise, and yet at times feels nearly unattainable (expensive, limited, dangerous) to achieve in most of america. one of the simple things that has been taken from us in the remaking of the world in the image of capital. feeling part of a collective, i think, is increasingly desired among people, and increasingly difficult to achieve in ways that have dimension beyond fractured identity associations. i&rsquo;ve been wondering about the lack of communality, or the places that it can be found, still, as i navigate what feels like an unprecedented time of disorientation. when ethnic cleansing tactics are both live streamed and funded by my government, i feel caught between access and powerlessness. able to see, over and over again, the blatant disregard for justice the western elite hold, i feel any optimistic electoralism or sense of a long arc of justice slip away. where is the village? it used to be in palestine, but then the settlers came and tore it down to make their own. it used to be in lenapehoking, but then the settlers came and built the city where i now search for what once was.

<h6 style="text-align: center;">reporting to you&nbsp;live from the conurbation</h6>

collectivity is essential in times of crisis, which is all the time, be it war or poverty or climate. one of the insidious influences of social media is its ability to keep us feeling individual, even as it feeds us poor semblances of community, served up via instagram infographic. an antidote to social media overwhelm is going outside, or &ldquo;touch grass&rdquo; as the saying goes. but &ldquo;touch grass&rdquo; is still about an individual response to a problem of social organization. we need to touch grass, and other people (with consent, ofc). it&rsquo;s particularly important in pivotal political moments, like the one we&rsquo;re living through (or at least i hope. i have to stay thinking this way to avoid losing hope) right now. the dynamism of the 2020 rebellion was in no small part due to the power of being able to form a collective body when the pandemic had severed us from that experience. there&rsquo;s a similarity here, to the severance of collectivity via land use, and the bubbling up of resistance that hinges on the ability to be together. i&rsquo;m tracing the wounds inflicted by capital, seeking salves of all kinds. in peripheries we&rsquo;re seeding new rituals for living well, new collective bodies, and a free palestine.


i turn to this approach in the face of my own utopian dissatisfaction. which is to say: i&rsquo;m dissatisfied with utopia. it&rsquo;s hardly a new idea, that all this talk of new worlds may not be doing what it means to do. i&rsquo;m going to be vague because this is a feeling i&rsquo;m still trying to understand, but the ideals of speculation and [prefix]futurism have not been resonating with me lately. perhaps i&rsquo;m entering my pessimist season. most of this is coming from a sense of an elite capture of the vocabulary of utopian speculation; as it cycles through alternative spaces and the art world, institutions catch on and dilute the purchase of such concepts.


how long before h&amp;m releases a shirt that says &ldquo;creating new worlds&rdquo; or something of the sort? and they are, i suppose. worlds of refuse and decay. zionism is a worldbuilding project. 1492 was, too. my intuitive response to this is to argue that these statements make it all the more imperative to build a liberatory worldbuilding impulse, and this is exactly the point raya and i made in our thesis, but part of practicing anti-stoicism for me means prodding deeper into these bad feelings, slowing down my learned impulse toward the solution, the intellectual fix, the self-satisfying remark. one of the dissonances (and there are many) in my life currently is between the bleak feeling i am holding regarding the future, and the general pleasantness of my life. privilege in the face of crisis, all arising from suffering that i&rsquo;m exempt from. pessimist kyle coming soon.
