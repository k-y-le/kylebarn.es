sometimes, all there is to do is witness. i’ve been witnessing, watching beautiful things flutter and fall. watching the sky, my vision framed by swaying branches. i find a patch of grass, dig my toes into the dirt, and lay back. the longer i witness, the more i begin to discern new textures to the world around me. gray skies begin to shimmer, clouds drifting in and out of my attention. how could i forget that the earth is layered, too? me, crust-borne creature. how can it be that we coax ourselves into such flat-mannered living?

i keep feeling as though i’ll get caught. i’m not working enough, i’m not productive enough. i’ve forgotten some key opportunity that i’ll regret later. it’s climate week in nyc, which is supposed to mean something. perhaps i should be networking. still, sometimes all there is to do is witness.

today’s another leach pit day; i’ve been seeping. going through old texts, reliving old moments, becoming leaky. a line from alice phoebe lou comes on as i write: *if you show me your cards, i’ll stop being the fool.* in the western world, we seem to love a clean break, but i think that heartbreak always lingers. there’s actually no fix, no other me to return to. in loving, i have been shaped; i cannot wish to be undone. 

i have this theory, that an essential part of understanding another person is knowing where they land on a spectrum. on one end is transition, the other is stability. transition people seek change, embrace change. they flutter. stability people want to know their setting, want to settle. 

when i’m alone at this park, i feel a desire to dance but feel as though i can’t act on that desire. at the edges of my vision, japanese pagoda tree branches are dancing in the wind. far above me, starlings dance in sweeping motions. all my life, i have been fighting social pressure to conform. lately, the pressure is sometimes too weak, or my spirit too strong. i leak. i flutter.

a list of things that are falling, as i lay and witness: leaves, dragonflies, starlings, sparrows, mosquitoes, others i cannot name. the grays deepen, signaling that the cumulus clouds have reached a point of being full to bursting. on my face, a drop of rain, almost imperceptible. add raindrops to the list.

my playlist is called *remember the fall?* fall as in autumn, season of transition. fall as in falling in love. today i don’t have much to say about love, except that it is a transition-maker. threshold-surpasser. boundary-decayer. love makes transitional your life. add teardrops to the list of things that are falling.

would the arcs of starlings in a sky ripe with rain make me cry, had i never fallen in love? when did i even fall in love, anyway? i, firmly on the transition side of the spectrum, find myself uninterested in answering these questions. sometimes, it’s best just to ask, to let the query linger. let it flutter, let it fall. 

i think it’s all more porous than we realize. by this i mean everything. the sky, the birds, the heart. we seem to spend so much of our time plugging holes, forgetting that there are always already new ones. i’m reaching for a metaphor here, a salve for the pain of unknowability regarding my emotional self. but i don’t want to find one. i just want to watch the birds.

the grays deepen further, this time with dusk’s lengthening shadows. suddenly, new silhouettes join the swooping of the birds. bats. bats! such erratic flight patterns, such endearing proportions of body to wing. i trace their path across my vision, smile warming my face, and try to imagine the feeling of waking up as the sun falls, hunger driving you across the water seeking insects grown lazy from the day. their flight patterns seem to stutter and start, which to my human eyes appear sloppy, slippery. but bats move this way to surprise bugs and evade birds. elegance isn’t always advantageous.

in this life, i am trying to be earnest. i am trying to be tender. the world is a rough and rugged place. i do not know where i will land within it. i do not aspire for fame or fortune, but to be rich in friendship. rich in wonder, and in joy. to feel the wind lift me up, to ask not where it will put me down, but to look bravely in the direction of uncertainty. i am trying to flutter, and i am trying to fall.
