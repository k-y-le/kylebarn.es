happy flower moon! she’s looking extra beautiful tonight. i wanted to share briefly some thoughts that i wrote up for the moon ritual last night, and further reflections today, as i meander my way through all the complicated feelings from it.

*in classic kyle fashion i have very few pictures from the actual event, except for this one when folks were just starting to arrive*

by the way, did anyone else have a fitful night of sleep last night? seems like a theme among many of the people in my life… not going to point fingers, just asking questions… anyways, on the flower moon:

———

we’ve passed spring in bloom. the city became green almost overnight. and so today we gather to celebrate the flower moon, so named for the flowering trees that are so abundant during this time of year. it’s a name that comes from the farmer’s almanac, and the Algonquin before that, allegedly, though its not clear what was appropriated and what was translated. colonial knowledge makes for strange distances.

spring is a season of strange distances. it’s mud, it’s pollen, it’s half-changed things. this year, i feel as though the blooming happened too quick. suddenly, it’s 80 degrees and everything is green. i had wanted to linger in the budding and the blooming, inhabit those strange distances. i had wanted to hold the soft moments of a magnolia in my hands. but spring, as always, has other ideas.

recently, i’ve been going on walks, looking for weeds. i’m obsessed with the dandelions with their gold burned off, seeds blown in the wind. all stem, they seem to me weary, having expended all their energy to dispel their seeds. this is what the flower moon feels like to me, this year. we could sit here and celebrate the most exotic and magnificent that the florist has to offer. or we could honor the humble dandelions in their passing by.

this moon, i asked everyone to bring an offering representing something that’s in bloom for you, in this phase of your life. i think there’s a straightforward interpretation of this — what’s been going well, what feels most alive, most rewarding? but i’m hoping to complicate, a bit, the narratives we hold around that word: bloom.

to be in bloom is to be in transition. it is not a resting place. it’s a bright, brief moment in the larger transition from frost to flourishing. i keep returning to fields of dandelion stems because they are the unwanted things, the weeds that we ignore or pull out, and yet they’re still brazenly spreading their seeds everywhere that can take them. i think that this, too, is the blooming. the stem that remains after the offering has been made.

what if blooming doesn’t just mean showing off the glamor of your successes, but instead reaching towards something you can’t quite make out yet? what if blooming is being seen before you feel totally ready? in the cycles of dandelions from flower to seed to stem, in the cycles of the moon from new to full and back again, fullness — and blooming — is always just one part of the rhythm.

so as we share offerings and reflections, i wanted to ask: what’s in bloom for you now? what’s changing shape? what are the soft petals of your life, your practice, or even your grief? so, let this be a place where your weeds are welcome — be they out-of-season, too-early, too-late, crooked or overflowing. where softness is not weakness but evidence of survival, of continuing on. where you are allowed to be unfinished.

———

at the ritual, i offered that i’ve been pondering this question, posed by olivia once: what if it was easy? a disarmingly simple ask, yet one that troubles the ways i tend to frame my own life. asking *what if it was easy* entails asking *what if i asked for what i really need?* and *what if i allowed myself to dream bigger about how society is organized?* to me, it is a utopian question.

i tend to feel some anxiety ahead of most gatherings i host, even though it pretty much always ends up being a wonderful time, once it gets going. lately, i’ve been stuck in loops of *why is it so hard?* in response to the difficulties i find when it comes to living a creative, queer life in a society running off capitalist exploitation of those very characteristics. i’ve been asking myself why i need to be so damn intentional. why can’t i settle for normativity?

what if it *was* easy? to make art and still make rent (or… no rent at all… just saying…). to have serendipitous run-ins with friends who are all neighbors. to find inspiring beautiful art. to know where my food comes from. to have the space to make the things i want to. to use my devices without feeling guilt afterwards. to connect, deeply, with those i spend my time with.

i’m working on all of these things, of course, and think that i’m living really close to my aspirations in many of these categories of experience. but that itself is a luxuries, a reflection of my privilege and yet still always precarious, one twist of fate away from becoming unavailable to me. here’s lauren berlant: “one is always in the middle of the broken world, but also that one is learning how to move in it without reproducing the conventional forms of its violence.”

the next day, sharing this with olivia, i realize how i’m just circling around queerness. it’s the thing that makes it harder to live in this world. it’s the intentionality (and the desire) that makes it feel impossible imagine a world in which all my friends can afford to find work and love and home and community in the same place. i could begrudge this, wish for some turn towards the normative. or i could celebrate all the incredible ways that queerness has offered me and others liberation. berlant, again, is helpful: “Queer work is skeptical about ordinary modes of attachment, repair, survival, and good objects. It describes the ambivalent position of being in desire while being unsure of what to do with what’s overwhelming or threatening in it, and it opens the floodgates about what can be an object of desire: persons, objects, ways of life, a landscape, an angle, pets, ideas, and so on”

ambivalent position, indeed. i was trying to accomplish something of this with my writing on the flower moon. complicating flowers, our friendly neighborhood decorative motifs, is a far cry from radically reimagining queer futurity. but i think it does open up some room for uncertainty, for inconvenience and ambivalence, in how we take metaphors. to me, being in bloom is being in skepticism about modes of attachment — that is, what’s being sold to me, what i do just because others do it that way, what assumptions end up baked into my experience without my recognizing them.

*my lil angles <3*

i like that berlant names “an angle” as a potential object of desire. putting together the altar for the flower moon, i found myself intensely drawn to the angles of dandelion stems. combine that with wind and a day of wilting in my bag, and the result is a panoply of angles scattered across the table. i found this beautiful, both in its leveraging of the discarded phase of a weed as an object of aesthetic beauty, but also in that it resists the impulse i felt to fill the table with a maximalist arrangement of floral abundance. no, something felt spiritually wrong with that approach, too closely connected to the extractive roots of the flower industry. too much aesthetic without enough ethic. so i’m going to go ahead call my little dandelion stem arrangements something queer, and i’m going to own it, because i’m in bloom when i stand in my convictions, turning to face the difficulty of the world, choosing to imagine that it could one day become some easeful horizon.
