“move fast and break things” goes the silicon valley creed, by way of patron saint mark zuckerberg. i’m sitting now on harvard’s campus, where facebook got its start moving fast (being creepy towards women) and breaking things (norms of cordiality). being a reactionary is so often about speed, because if you move fast you don’t have enough time to listen to those who are being left behind.

in it’s newest flavor, effective accelerationism (e/acc), this philosophy further crystallizes technological “progress” as essential to a livable future. [here’s](https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/) marc andreesen, paving the way for the VC-reactionary crossover like never before: “we believe the techno-capital machine of markets and innovation never ends, but instead spirals continuously upward.” i suppose it’s easy to understand how one might see techno-capitalism as a source of infinite abundance when it has made one millions, but it also demonstrates a stunning inability to grasp exploitation. it’s fairly obvious how capitalism is not, actually, a upward spiral for all, and so i’m more interested in how abundance operates here. abundance trends in both reactionary neo-fascist accelerationist circles, and among the left degrowth ancestral knowledge folks. despite a shared vision of abundance for all, the means by which we get there are quite different. is it an infinite techno-capitalist spiral, or a slow reconnection with nature’s bounty?

it’s a back and forth. the gradual collective acceptance of the anthropocene concept, among different forms, induces pessimism about the wretchedness of our futures (i’ll note, too, that [some early writing](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674545038) on the anthropocene refers to it as “the great acceleration” — it’s always been about changes in social velocity). but pessimism does not fit the political project of getting us out of this mess, and so we turn to abundance, whether to accumulate more capital or to build more of an ecological politics. i find it critical that we make a claim to a planetary abundance, one grounded in the constantly negotiated harmony of ecological systems, in a moment where the effective accelerationists are trying to run away with the term.

part of the narrative of “move fast and break things” relies upon the novelty factor: the (untrue) belief that accelerationism emerged naturally from the innovations of the west coast tech industry. but like all reactionary ideologies, that’s a purposeful obfuscation. take filippo tommaso marinetti, in the 1909 *manifesto for futurism:* “Let us go! At last Mythology and the mystic cult of the ideal have been left behind. We are going to be present at the birth of the centaur and we shall soon see the first angels fly! We must break down the gates of life to test the bolts and the padlocks! Let us go!” what the italian futurists and the effective accelerationists share is a strong connection to their contemporary movements of fascism. where they differ, honestly, is that the futurists at least had a cohesive boundary-pushing style, while the dominant taste of the silicon valley reactionary seems to be centered around a strange mass manufactured marble statue [startup](https://www.monumentallabs.co/).

i’m drawn into this intellectual world because i’m in cambridge attending a [conference](https://data.org/get-involved/accelerate-conference/) titled accelerate: data for social impact. and i’m wondering what we really mean, here, as we talk about acceleration alongside issues of women’s reproductive healthcare, water quality monitoring, and increasing access to medium range weather forecasting. i’m landing at two terms: context, and inertia. the first is pretty straightforward: we need to be able to approach each issue of our world with appropriate context. no surprises there, but still needs to be said (especially within the nonprofit industrial complex). perhaps accelerate means that we should accelerate the means by which marginalized groups are able to create their own solutions to their problems, while decelerating the tendency of social impact orgs to lay claim to that agency. and that brings me to inertia. the world we’re living in was engineered — and i use this word deliberately — to keep accelerating. it was engineered to keep exploiting an abundance of people and planet until we’re locked into a techno-capital spiral, whether its taking you up or down. some things do need to accelerate, because the inertia of development means that a just transition should accelerate the quality of living of marginalized people and ecosystems. we also quite literally have to accelerate the drawdown of carbon from the atmosphere if we are to avert the worst possible futures of climate change; this is not negotiable. so here i sit, on the campus that played host to the development of what is now the 7th most valuable company in the world, asking what still needs to move fast, what still needs to break, for a livable future.
