farah led a multisensory walk this past sunday at the naval cemetery landscape, where she’s doing a residency. it was a really sweet time, a good reason to spend time outside, intentionally, despite the cold. there’s something quite magical about a northeastern winter landscape — the flora seems somehow more alien, with its tans and browns and craggly shapes.

perhaps my favorite part of the walk was laying down on the elevated platforms, getting up close and personal with the dead leaves, strewn branches, and other detritus on its way to becoming humus. when you get close, the seemingly muted environment reveals itself to be secretly bursting with color. bright red leaves, the last green branches of the year, richly dark soil, all tangled together in their unraveling. it is a beautiful thing to look closely at the process of becoming earth, again.

at the far south corner of the park, there’s a bench with a little cubby underneath it. inside is a journal, put there by an organization i was just introduced to, [nature sacred](https://naturesacred.org/), which sponsors these benches in order to prompt reflection and contemplation of nature, particularly in urban environments. the idea is quite sweet to me, that by placing a journal, you can offer a portal to the others who have sat in the same place, observed the same ecosystem in a different phase or season. i’m sure it’s also helpful for grant applications for the organization, legibility is important, and sometimes difficult when it comes to nebulous definitions of wellness. 

the most dominating presence in the naval cemetery landscape is not even within the bounds of the park — the brooklyn-queens expressway looms next door. rushing cars pass by, and in doing so impart a dull roar that is seemingly constant throughout the park. being present in the naval cemetery landscape feels like bearing witness to an ongoing battle over the proper use of urban space. the BQE represents a disintegrating legacy of a car-centric past and still a vital freight corridor for trucks bringing goods to and from the neighborhood, while the naval cemetery landscape represents the green urbanist vision of the [brooklyn greenway initiative](https://www.brooklyngreenway.org/naval-cemetery-landscape/) — bike paths, pedestrian safety, native plants. even as i tuned into the winter vibrancy of the ecosystem, i couldn’t shake the tension of these two forces. so when i opened the nature sacred book to add my own reflections, for some reason i wrote the following, which i will transcribe for legibility:

I CAN FEEL THE RUMBLING OF TRAFFIC WITHIN ME. ALL DAY LONG: RUMBLE RUMBLE RUMBLE.

I WANT TO RUMBLE BACK. CAST A SPELL UPON THE CARS. I AM ONE HUNDRED FEET TALL AND VEHICLES QUAKE IN MY PRESENCE.

ONE DAY, ALL THIS HIGHWAY WILL BECOME FERAL, AGAIN. COATED IN BRACKISH WATER. I WANT TO FLOOD. TO BE FLOODED.

WHEN THAT HAPPENS, THE RUMBLING WILL CEASE, BUT ALL WILL NOT BE QUIET. QUIET IS A HUMAN THING. COARSE, UNSUBTLE.

ONE DAY I WILL BACK INTO EARTH — DECOMPOSE. AND IT WILL RUMBLE UPON MY RETURN.

part of the prompt from farah was to turn off our brains, and sense into a more intuitive self. i guess that’s what came out of my intuitive self, as i listened to the rumble, sniffed empty milkweed pods, and tasted the soil.

*turned out i never took a picture of the actual landscape itself so here's the journal entry + a pic farah took of me with my mittens that sam got me at the end of creature class <3*
