in the bathroom at golda, i think to myself “today i feel like a salad of bones and tendons.” neeta says that she feels like the wind would blow right through her body. now i’m thinking about lotus root, and gongshi, all the holy holey things. how special to wander the mind through the crevasses of a stone, how generous to attend to the warp and weft of air and space and other unseen things.

the two most essential parts of a salad are water and air, i think. a juicy lettuce leaf, the spaciousness around a kale’s contours folding in on itself. i have always thrown my body around, healed slower from injuries than i should because of it. during morning yoga, i’m hit by a sudden gorey emotion. that’s all i can describe it as - not a vision of gore, but a feeling. it’s uneasy, destabilizing, possibly even disregulating. though i don’t really know what disregulating means. where are its boundaries? somehow we’re always groping for the fuzzy ambiguities that surround us. a salad can be ambiguous, can be surprising, i think. here’s lauren berlant: “life can be different; it can be better or worse. just not simple, in the sense of resolved once and for all.”

yesterday i got my flu and covid shots, and i keep telling myself that the salad-feeling must be because i’m returning to my morning workouts routine after an injury. i must not be reacting to the shots, even though that’s almost definitely a large part of the soreness i feel. because i’ve built this narrative around myself that i am impervious to these things. i have declared something unambiguous. i have made a shape out of the fuzziness around me.

friends keep inviting me to evening events and hangs and i keep saying no, because i’m busy. i’m working most weeknights, in some way or another. working most days, too. if not, i have some event or gathering myself. on tuesday, i told nicholas that i am inhabiting the mellow fall energy, fresh off an on again off again work day. on friday, i tell isa that i feel like a leaf caught in the churn of a strong breeze. how to respond to the question: “how are you?” how have you been? really, truly? i reach for metaphors, make shapes in the fuzz. life can be different. it can be better or worse. i am probably taking on too much.

i have chosen a life of constant transition. this is deliberate. i’ve steered myself here on many occasions, when stability was offered and i politely declined. i dart between creative projects, freelance work, absconding routines. the thing about a salad is that it gets tossed. the pieces mix together, they jumble. churn, even.

i love being piecemeal, i love change, i love transition. i am never one whole thing. one full thing. air and water and soreness which is actually so sweet isn’t it, really? to be sore is a gift, an offering from the interior, a reminder of the crevasses within us. we are holy holey things. berlant, again: “we live in disturbance, cultivating heuristics and processes to move with and within the space of being affected, even when it’s bad.”
