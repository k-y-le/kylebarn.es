2025 begins with me in my room. honoring my new year’s ritual, i’ve taken shrooms, and my original plan to spend most of the day in prospect park is quickly forgotten. mostly, i cry.

in january, the year feels like it really begins with a tender moon party. everyone has such cool projects to share, so i start the moon bulletin newsletter, as an experiment in  sharing friends’ events. i feel socially confident, uplifted, a steward of community. less than a week later, i have a terrible time at a party that undoes all that confidence. i begin to wonder if things are unraveling, as they seemingly always do at the beginning of the year.

in february, it unravels. the day after my breakup, i host a party. the next day is my last day of work. i start looking for new roommates. at the brazilian techno rave that weekend, i think to myself “actually, it’s going to be alright…” i feel like i’m in one of those old ipod commercials, with the black silhouettes and pops of color.

*girl who is going to be okay*

in march, olivia and i go to the zoo the week after she quits her job. we spend an extremely long time in the mouse house and just as long laying in the sun on a rock right after. on the way home, we get pints of ice cream and i feel a little ill from eating too much.

in april, we teach a workshop at pratt for a bunch of masters students who probably didn’t really get it. a week later, my new roommates move in — the apartment feels full and then empty and then full again. a few days later, and i’m leading an egg tour on easter sunday, before heading to a mycelium embodiment workshop. the city is warming up, and i find bike rides to be joyous again. my life feels full and then empty and then full again.

*making the kids touch grass*

in may, olivia and i take a weekend day to do shrooms and make our way to prospect park. we spend most of our time lying face-down in the grass. any embarrassment over being obviously on drugs in a busy park is washed away when we realize that we’re actually just… always like this. sometimes, you go into a trip expecting revelation, but end up just enjoying the smells and sounds and tastes of the grass.

in june, devlin joins olivia and i on the hottest day of the year to record a short film about olivia’s monchichi called paya. the park is sweltering and nearly empty, not least because it’s a wednesday afternoon. but the park is still home; we start teaching classes there after flyering around the city, feeling anxious that anyone would take a chance on such a niche idea.

in july, i arrive to willa’s upstate residency sick and tired. not of something in particular, just literally sick, and literally tired. this is right after wrapping up our classes, hosting an outrageous immersive theatre party, and a packed housewarming. i swim in a pond and read in a clawfoot tub, taking stock of all the changes in my life. my nephew is born, and i become an uncle, too.

*real ones eat dirt, rocks, bark, etc.*

in august, i enter into solitude. leaving behind the bustle of the city, i embark on a self-directed residency, just me and the mountains of colorado. my days are suddenly unfamiliar, empty. i read a lot, write a book, draw, make prints, and mostly spend every day dancing on the mountain. also, i keep crying. it’s a wet summer in the mountains, anyways.

in september, alice i and i ring in the “real new year” with a shrooms trip at fort tilden beach. after hours of mostly stillness, i finally muster up the courage to enter the water, finding myself bathed in oceanic feeling. mountain, ocean, city, all swirl around me. i celebrate my birthday with a weekend bookended by dancing, adding to the swirl.

*took the roomies to basement*

in october, i injure my foot in a soccer game, and rail against my newfound inability to attend yoga, volleyball, soccer, and more. we still host our scavenger hunt / immersive theatre halloween party, even though olivia’s sick, too.

in november, i sing in public for the first time, nervous yet eager. the weather gets colder and i hunker down, layering up and taking on more work than before. things begin to slow, but also accelerate.

in december, we win our first soccer championships. despite getting pantsed in the finals (yes, literally…) i score a few goals and walk away with a championship scarf. i spend christmas with my family, including my now five-month old nephew, who is the center of attention.

2025 ends on a rooftop in crown heights. i’m yelling, not totally sure what i’m saying, leading a few dozen in a ritual to ring in the new year. it feels so good to scream, to release, to make space for the year ahead. in 2025, there was so, so much to be grateful for. there was also so much loss, difficulty, loneliness, and frustration. i’m not sure i’m in a better or worse place, just a different one. different combinations of people around me, different adventures ahead. different anxieties, different hopes. to love is to be changed, and looking back at the year behind me, i feel that acutely.
